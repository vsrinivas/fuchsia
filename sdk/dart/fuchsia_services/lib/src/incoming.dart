/// ```
/// final incoming = Incoming();
/// final launchInfo = LaunchInfo(
///   url: serverUrl,
///   directoryRequest: incoming.request().passChannel(),
/// );
///
/// final launcherProxy = LauncherProxy();
/// context.incoming.connectToService(launcherProxy);
///
/// launcherProxy.createComponent(launchInfo, ctrl);
/// final myProxy = MyProxy();
/// incoming.connectToService(myProxy);
///
/// incoming.close();
/// ```
///

/// ambiently offered by the Component Framework.
