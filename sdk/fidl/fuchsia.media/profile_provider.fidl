    /// `name` is the name of a system scheduling role to apply to the thread given by
    /// `thread_handle` -- different products may customize the underlying scheduling strategy based
    /// on the requested role. `period` is the suggested interval to be scheduled at. `period` may
    /// be zero if the thread has no preferred scheduling interval. `capacity` is the proportion of
    /// the scheduling interval the thread needs to be running to achieve good performance or to
    /// meet the scheduling deadline defined by `period`. `capacity` may be zero if the workload has
    /// no firm runtime requirements. Note that `capacity` should be a good faith estimate based on
    /// the worst case runtime the thread requires each period.  Excessive capacity requests may
    /// be rejected or result in scaling back the performance of other threads to fit resource

    /// performance processor(s) in the system. The system will automatically adjust the effective
