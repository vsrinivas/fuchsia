/// `DebugDataController` is an internal fidl protocol exposed by the debug_data component.

/// this protocol to define isolated sets of debug data per test run, although in the future, it
/// may define finer grained sets (such as per test suite).
///
/// `DebugDataController` operates in conjunction with events passed from Component Manager.
/// Specifically, DebugData consumes CapabilityRequested, Started, and Stopped events. These
/// events allow it to route a fuchsia.debugdata.Publisher connection to a specific component
/// within a test. DebugData can then attribute that component to a specific test and test run
/// using information it is passed through `DebugDataController` and `DebugDataSetController`.
