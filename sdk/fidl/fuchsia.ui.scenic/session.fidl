    /// `acquire_fences` are used by Scenic to wait until all of the session's
    /// resources are ready to render (or to allow downstream components, such as
    /// the Vulkan driver, to wait for these resources).
    ///
    /// For example, Fuchsia's Vulkan driver allows an zx::event to be obtained
    /// from a VkSemaphore.  This allows a Scenic client to submit a Vulkan command
    /// buffer to generate images/meshes/etc., and instructing Vulkan to signal a
    /// VkSemaphore when it is done.  By inserting the zx::event corresponding to
    /// this semaphore into `acquire_fences`, the client allows Scenic to submit work
    /// to the Vulkan driver without waiting on the CPU for the event to be
    /// signalled.
    ///
    /// `release_fences` is a list of events that will be signalled by Scenic when
    /// the updated session state has been fully committed: future frames will be
    /// rendered using this state, and all frames generated using previous session
    /// states have been fully-rendered and presented to the display.
    ///
    /// Together, `acquire_fences` and `release_fences` are intended to allow clients
    /// to implement strategies such as double-buffering.  For example, a client
    /// might do the following in the Scenic subsystem:
    ///   1) create two Image with resource IDs #1 and #2.
    ///   2) create two Materials with resource IDs #3 and #4, which respectively
    ///      use Images #1 and #2 as their texture.
    ///   3) create a tree of Nodes and attach them to the scene.
    ///   4) set one of the nodes above, say #5, to use Material #3.
    ///   5) submit a Vulkan command-buffer which renders into Image #1, and
    ///      will signal a VkSemaphore.
    ///   6) call Present() with one acquire-fence (obtained from the VkSemaphore
    ///      above) and one newly-created release-fence.
    ///
    /// After the steps above, Scenic will use the committed session state to render
    /// frames whenever necessary.  When the client wants to display something
    /// different than Image #1, it would do something similar to steps 4) to 6):
    ///   7) set Node #5 to use Material #4.
    ///   8) submit a Vulkan command-buffer which renders into Image #1, and
    ///      will signal a VkSemaphore.
    ///   9) call Present() with one acquire-fence (obtained from the VkSemaphore
    ///      above) and one newly-created release-fence.
    ///
    /// Finally, to continually draw new content, the client could repeat steps
    /// 4) to 9), with one important difference: step 5) must wait on the event
    /// signalled by step 9).  Otherwise, it might render into Image #1 while that
    /// image is still being used by Scenic to render a frame.  Similarly, step 8)
    /// must wait on the event signalled by step 6).
    ///
    /// The scenario described above uses one acquire-fence and one release-fence,
    /// but it is easy to imagine cases that require more.  For example, in addition
    /// to using Vulkan to render into Images #1 and #2, the client might also
    /// upload other resources to Vulkan on a different VkQueue, which would
    /// would signal a separate semaphore, and therefore require an additional
    /// acquire-fence.
    ///

    /// access to memory (and other external resources).  Any modification to
    /// resources made via the Session API are automatically synchronized.
