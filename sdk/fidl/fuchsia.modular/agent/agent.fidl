/// An agent is a component whose lifecycle is not tied to any Story.
///
/// - An agent is a singleton instance.
/// - Components can connect to an Agent using the
///   fuchsia.modular.ComponentContext capability.
/// - An agent vends services to components that connect to it over a
///   ServiceProvider.
/// - An agent is started when someone wants to connect to it, or when a task it
///   has scheduled has triggered.
///
/// This FIDL interface should be implemented by a component that is meant to be
/// run as an Agent.
///
/// When an agent application implements the |Lifecycle| interface, it can
/// receive a signal for when it should stop. An agent may be stopped for the
/// following reasons:
///
/// (1) All |AgentController| connections associated with this agent are closed.
///
/// (2) The system wants to optimize for resources.
///
/// Once the framework delivers a |Lifecycle.Terminate()|, the agent application
/// may exit itself, or is killed by framework after a timeout.
///
/// For more info see:
/// - fuchsia.modular.AgentContext and fuchsia.modular.ComponentContext for
///   capabilities an agent has.
/// - fuchsia.modular.Lifecycle for how Components get lifecycle events.
[Discoverable] // Created by each agent.

    ///      with :'s escaped (see below for a complete explanation).
    ///    * For all other clients (Agents and Shells), |requestor_url| is set to the requesting
    ///      component's URL.

    /// them. This is called a module path. If created by 1) an agent or 2) an existing module, the
    /// path is constructed differently.

    /// the new module's name, as provided by the parent module. In the case of (1), the module
    /// path is the concatenation of StoryCommand.AddMod/mod_name and
    /// StoryCommand.AddMod/surface_relation_parent.

    /// TODO(alhaad): The current implementation allows the Agent to run a task
    /// until its callback returns. If the task takes a long time to finish, the
    /// framework has no way to signal a request for termination other than to shut
    /// down the entire Agent instance. Instead, we should cap task length with
