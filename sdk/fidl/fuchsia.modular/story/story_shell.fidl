// This interface is implemented by a story shell. Dependencies are passed to it
// in Initialize() on startup. The story shell is also expected to implement
// Lifecycle in order to receive a Terminate() call on teardown.
//
// In one component instance there can only be one StoryShell service instance.
// The view token is sent to the separate View service. This way, the story
// shell may be implemented as a flutter component.
//
// Teardown may occur via the session shell calling StoryController.Stop(), the
// sessionmgr being terminated, or by the system shutting down.
[Discoverable] // Created by story shell applications.
