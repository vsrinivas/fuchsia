/// These methods do not return until after the state transition has been completed. In most cases
/// (e.g. Reboot), a successful transition means that the caller does not actually observe the
/// completion because the system will be rebooted before the call is completed. The implication is
/// that using a synchronous FIDL client with these methods will result in a blocked thread for the
/// duration of the call, or even for the remainder of the component's life (in the case of Reboot).
/// Therefore, if a synchronous FIDL client is to be used with this protocol then care should be
/// taken to avoid handling any shutdown-induced callbacks on the same thread that was used to
/// initiate the transition. Example callbacks include [`fuchsia.process.lifecycle/Lifecycle.Stop`]
/// and [`fuchsia.hardware.power.statecontrol/RebootMethodsWatcher.OnReboot`].
/// Alternatively, the caller could choose to use an asynchronous FIDL client with this protocol to
/// avoid blocking their calling thread.
