/// ImagePipe is a mechanism for streaming shared images between a producer
/// and a consumer which may be running in different processes.
///
/// Conceptually, the image pipe maintains a table of image resources supplied
/// by the producer into which graphical content may be stored as well as a
/// presentation queue containing a sequence of images which the producer has
/// asked the consumer to present.
///
/// The presentation queue is initially empty.
///
/// Each entry in the presentation queue consists of an image together with a
/// pair of optional synchronization fences:
/// - Acquire fence: signaled by the producer when the image is ready to be consumed
/// - Release fence: signaled by the consumer when the image is free to be freed or
///   modified by the producer
///
/// The producer performs the following sequence of steps to present content:
/// - Allocate and add some number of BufferCollections to the image pipe to allow
/// consumer to set constraints.
/// - Allocate and add some number of images (often 2 or 3) to the image pipe
///   to establish a pool using `AddImage()`.
/// - Obtain the next available image from the pool.
/// - Ask the consumer to enqueue an image for presentation and provide fences
///   using `PresentImage()`.
/// - Start rendering the image.
/// - Signal the image's acquire fence when rendering is complete.
/// - Loop to present more image, listen for signals on release fences to recycle
///   images back into the pool.
///
/// The consumer performs the following sequence of steps for each image which
/// is enqueued in the presentation queue:
/// - Await signals on the image's acquire fence.
/// - If the fence wait cannot be satisfied or if some other error is detected,
///   close the image pipe.
///   Otherwise, begin presenting the image's content.
/// - Retire the previously presented image (if any) from the presentation queue
///   and signal its release fence when no longer needed.
/// - Continue presenting the same image until the next one is ready.  Loop.
///
/// If the producer wants to close the image pipe, it should:
/// - Close its side of the connection.
/// - Wait on all release fences for buffers that it has submitted with
///   `PresentImage()`.
/// - Proceed with resource cleanup.
///
/// When the consumer detects the image pipe has closed, it should:
/// - Stop using/presenting any images from the pipe.
/// - Unmap all memory objects associated with the images in the pipe.
/// - Close all BufferCollection resources.
/// - Signal all release fences for presented and queued buffers.
/// - Close all handles to fences.
/// - Close its side of the connection.
///
/// When either party detects that a fence has been abandoned (remotely closed
/// without being signaled) it should assume that the associated image is in
/// an indeterminate state.  This will typically happen when the other party
/// (or one of its delegates) has crashed.  The safest course of action is to
/// close the image pipe, release all resources which were shared with the
/// other party, and re-establish the connection to recover.
