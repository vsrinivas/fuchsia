/// Represents a session with a Network device.
///
/// A session has a data plane and a control plane. The `Session` protocol
/// represents the control plane of the session and the FIFOs and VMOs exchanged
/// during the [`Device.OpenSession`] call are the data plane. Lifetime of the
/// session is controlled by a `Session` protocol handle.
///
/// Sessions must attach to ports of interest to start receiving and sending
/// data. Sessions are always created with no ports attached.
///
/// If a port is destroyed from the underlying device, it is automatically
/// detached from the session.
///
/// Inbound traffic is dispatched to all open sessions. Devices typically
/// operate with a single primary session, see [`SessionFlags.PRIMARY`]. Each
/// additional open session to the same device causes data copy overhead on the
/// device's data path.
///
/// The session is closed with an error epitaph if an invalid buffer descriptor
/// is sent over either the tx or rx FIFOs. Invalid descriptors include:
///    - Descriptor index larger than [`SessionInfo.descriptor_count`].
///    - Descriptor chains larger than [`MAX_DESCRIPTOR_CHAIN`].
///    - rx buffers smaller than [`Info.min_rx_buffer_length`].
///    - tx buffers smaller than [`Info.min_tx_buffer_length`].
///    - tx buffers not respecting [`Info.min_tx_buffer_head`] or
///      [`Info.min_tx_buffer_tail`].
