/// An instance of a network device exposed on devfs.
// NOTE(brunodalbo) This protocol exists to sidestep the fact that the DDK
// doesn't allow devices to own their channels. The Device framework implicitly
// composes fuchsia.device/Controller on channels obtained through devfs, and
// the "composed" implementation is always provided by the framework itself. At
// the time of this writing it is unclear what is going to replace that or when,
// only that there is a desire to improve the pattern. The expectation is that
// pattern will be improved with Unified Services (https://fxbug.dev/8035) and
// Drivers as Components (https://fxbug.dev/33183).
