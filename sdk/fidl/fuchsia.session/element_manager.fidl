/// An interface used to add elements to a session.
///
/// An *element* is a component that is expected to be instantiated as a child
/// of the session and to interact with the user in some way. An *element proposer*
/// is a component that calls `ProposeElement` to add an element to the session.
///
/// The session will typically implement `ElementManager` and provide it
/// to its child element proposers.
///
/// For example, an element proposer may be a non-interactive application that
/// listens to the network for a command to display an element to the user.
/// When it receives the command, the element proposer proposes to add an
/// element to the session via the `ElementManager` protocol. Similarly,
/// the element proposer may be part of an interactive user interface that
/// proposes elements based on user input.

    ///
    /// If `ProposeElement` returns without error, the caller can assume
    /// the element is now part of the session. However, whether or not the
    /// element component is actively running, or not, depends on the session
    /// implementation. For example, a session may decide to conserve resources by
    /// suspending an element which is not visible, or delay the running of an
    /// element until a more appropriate time.
