/// For example, the keys from section [3.10 Multimedia keys][2] will be located

/// in this enum prior to the introduction of the convention have not been moved,
/// and values that go logically into pre-existing sections have been inserted
/// into their logical place using the prior convention (see below). This allows
/// us to extract the section ranges if this is for some reason useful to the
/// application.

/// ## Prior to API version 9
///
/// The space of the nonprintable keys is subdivided roughly to correspond to the
/// subsections of Section 3 of the document Named Key Attribute Values.
/// The choice for the section values is arbitrary, so long as blocks of
/// values are allocated at once, and the keys with similar purpose are kept
/// together.
