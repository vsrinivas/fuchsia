    // opposed to the Power Manager discovering the protocols in the usual way) in order to
    // satisfy the requirement that Driver Manager has a dependency on Power Manager (and not the
    // reverse) according to the Component Manager capability routes. This requirement ensures
    // that during shutdown, the Driver Manager will be stopped before the Power Manager, allowing
    // the Power Manager to observe and react to any potential failures during the shutdown
    // process.
