/// ViewProvider is the standard mechanism for two modules to each obtain half

/// modules to ask Scenic to create a ViewHolder/View pair.  The resulting
/// View and ViewHolder are linked together until either one is destroyed.
///
/// Modules are free to use any other mechanism to agree upon the shared
/// eventpair token, and use this to create the linked ViewHolder/View.
/// ViewProvider is given for the convenience of clients that don't require
/// a more complex implementation.
