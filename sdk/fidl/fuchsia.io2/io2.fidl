/// E.g. `foo`
///
/// ## Invariants
///
/// A valid node name must meet the following criteria:
///
/// * It cannot be longer than [`MAX_NAME_LENGTH`].
/// * It cannot be empty.
/// * It cannot be ".." (dot-dot).
/// * It cannot be "." (single dot).
/// * It cannot contain "/".
/// * It cannot contain embedded NUL.

/// A path is a string of one or more components, separated by "/".
/// E.g. `foo/bar/baz`
///
/// ## Invariants
///
/// A valid path must meet the following criteria:
///
/// * It cannot be empty.
/// * It cannot be longer than [`MAX_PATH_LENGTH`].
/// * It cannot have a leading "/".
/// * It cannot have a trailing "/".
/// * Each component must be a valid [`Name`].
///
/// Paths should be transformed into their canonical forms at client side.
/// For example, a client should convert `"foo/bar/.././baz/"` to `"foo/baz"`
/// before using it as a path.

/// unique node ID.
///
/// ## Uniqueness Guarantees
///
/// A client is usually presented with a directory tree that is the result
/// of composing together multiple backing implementation instances. An ID
/// would be unique within the corresponding instance only.
/// Their boundaries are rather implicit on Fuchsia, as a result of
/// transparently-forwarding directory proxies. It could be common for a client
/// to observe identical `Id`s when traversing a directory tree, when it
/// encounters nodes from different backing instances. Therefore, the ID is best
/// used for debugging and informational purposes.
///
/// If the implementation also supports [`fuchsia.fs/Query`], the
/// [`fuchsia.fs/FilesystemInfo.fs_id`] field may be used to disambiguate IDs
/// from different backing instances.
