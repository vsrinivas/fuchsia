/// State
/// The driver consists of three main pieces of state:
///
/// 1. A PCI BAR that clients can suballocate into. This is used for mapping
/// coherent memory from the hardware, such as for Vulkan HOST_COHERENT
/// memory, or for any other buffer owned by the hardware such as video
/// codec buffers. This also includes a mapping where each connection of the
/// driver is associated with one or more mappings.
///
/// The next two pieces of state are for child driver connections.
///
/// 2. A set of context handles, one per driver connection that the client
/// establishes. This is used to support higher-level/VMM-defined (child)
/// drivers. Each such driver is considered a "child" driver of goldfish
/// address space.
///
/// 3. A set of command pages, one per connection. This is used as a shared
/// device/host memory to support the "Ping" command. The "Ping" command is used
/// to run the child driver logic, driven by the app. There is a protocol to
/// permanently associate a particular goldfish address space driver connection
/// with a particular type of child driver, discussed next.

/// Child driver protocol
///
/// By default, creating connection to the driver does not associate any child
/// driver with the connection.
///
/// The client opens a child driver via OpenChildDriver, giving the type of the
/// driver as an argument along with a request for the connection.  The type of
/// the driver is a number and the number/drivertype mapping is
/// determined/maintained in:
/// https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/qemu/+/refs/heads/emu-master-dev/android/android-emu/android/emulation/AddressSpaceService.h
///
/// In Fuchsia, we currently only support the DEFAULT type, which is used for
/// graphics.
///
/// After opening the child driver, the client and hardware communicate via a
/// child driver-specific protocol, with notifications driven by `Ping()`, each
/// of which writes and reads messages to the hardware that follow this
/// `AddressSpaceChildDriverPingMessage` struct.
/// Each child driver type will have its own semantics for each field.
/// It's common for child drivers to refer to offset/size plus a metadata field.
/// We also provide extra data fields for other use cases in particular child
/// drivers.
