/// TOPOLOGY
///
/// Each puppet is assumed to own exactly one view.
///
/// Each piece of content added is assumed to be a "direct child" of this view;
/// and a sibling of the rest of the view's contents. In other words, all
/// embedded views, filled rects, etc. are considered to have "sibling" semantics;
/// for example, repositioning or resizing one piece of content should not
/// reposition/resize any other piece of content.
///
/// Z-ORDERING
///
/// The contents of a puppet's view are z-ordered according to the order in which
/// they were created. The first piece of content created appears at the "bottom",
/// and the last piece of content created appears at the "top".
///
/// IDS
///
/// All ids must be globally unique, e.g. a "filled rect" id belongs to the same
/// id space as an "embedded view" id.
///
/// SYNCHRONIZATION
///
/// All methods should block until the frame containing the requested changes has
/// rendered to the display, if a new frame is required.
///
/// RETURN VALUES
///
/// See documentation on the `Result` enum above.
///
/// UNKNOWN INTERACTIONS
///
/// Puppet implementations may live outside of fuchsia.git, so they will encounter
/// unknown methods and/or fields any time we extend the puppet API. In these cases,
