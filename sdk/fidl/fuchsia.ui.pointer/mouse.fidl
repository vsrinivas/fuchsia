/// The position of a pointer event is defined in the context of a viewport,
/// situated in the view. The dimensions of the view and viewport, and their
/// spatial relationship (defined with a transform matrix), are supplied
/// synchronously in a |ViewParameter| table. A view may retrieve a pointer's
/// position in its local coordinate system by applying the viewport-to-view
/// transform matrix.
///
/// The viewport is embedded in an independent and stable coordinate system,
/// suitable for interpreting pointer events in a scale-independent manner;
/// mouse movement will be observed at a constant scale, even under effects such
/// as magnification or panning. However, other effects, such as enlargening the
/// view's clip bounds, may trigger a change in the viewport extents.
