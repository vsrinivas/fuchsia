### run the debug agent on target and connect to it with zxdb

## Starts the debug agent on the proposed target and automatically connect zxdb
## to it. Will close the debug agent on exit.
##
## TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:
##
## - Remember to use "fx set-device" when working with multiple devices.
## - This scripts by default will mute the SSH connection stdout/stderr, so any
##   errors triggered by it won't appear. Use the --verbose-agent flag to see
##   the output.
## - This scripts uses the tool "nc" for testing TCP connections. Check that it
##   is in $PATH and that it works.
##
## Usage: fx debug [(--port|-p) <PORT>] [(--verbose-agent|-va)]
##
##    --port            Port the debug agent will be listening on. Will use 2345
##                      by default.
##    --verbose-agent   Whether the debug agent's stdout/stderr should be shown.
##                      Useful for debugging the debugger. Yo' dawg.
##
## Flags after -- are parsed by zxdb.  See zxdb's documentation for more
## details.
