#### CATEGORY=Device discovery
### set the default device to interact with

## usage: fx set-device [<device-name>]
##
## fx set-device is used to specify the default device to target for various
## fx commands, such as serve, syslog, and so on.
## A device is set within the scope of a build directory (i.e. out/arm64 may
## have a different pair set than out/x64).
##
## If no device name is given, set-device will attempt to discover devices. If
## one device is found, that device is set as the default for the current build
## directory. If more than one device is found, the user must select one and
## provide it to a subsequent invocation of the command.
##
## To unset, use `fx unset-device`.
