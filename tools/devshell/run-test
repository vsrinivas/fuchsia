### build a test package and run on target.

## usage: fx run-test PKG_TARGET [runtests flags]
##
## Builds the update package group, updates the device as necessary, and then
## executes the test as specified by [runtests flags] (or all tests in
## PKG_TARGET if no flags are given).
##
## Arguments:
##   PKG_TARGET    A package name as appears in `fx list-packages`
##   All later arguments are passed directly to `runtests`, see `fx run-test -h` for all flags.
##
## Known Bugs:
## PKG-592: After run-test, performing a pave without executing 'fx build'
## results in "appmgr not started after 20s", as this command only builds new
## packages, it avoids creating new paver artifacts, as such, a pave without a
## fresh build produces a system with inconsistent state.
