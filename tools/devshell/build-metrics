When enabled, fx builds will upload anonymized remote build logs
to collect valuable build performance data.

1. For every "fx build" invocation that uses remote building (RBE):
   - Reproxy logs containing details about every remote build action,
     e.g. timing breakdown, cache hit/miss, statuses, internal errors.

Each build can be identified by a UUID (not traceable to any user),
but can be voluntarily referenced in bug reports and triage sessions.
