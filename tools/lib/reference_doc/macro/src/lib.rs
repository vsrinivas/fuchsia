/// Macro that adds an implementation of the trait MarkdownReferenceDocGenerator
/// to structs with `derive(ReferenceDoc)`. The trait adds the fn
/// `get_markdown_reference_docs()`. The return value is generated by consuming the
/// struct's field names, types, and doc comments. Markdown headers in the
/// doc comments are appropriately indendented based on the context in which
/// they appear.
///
/// Attributes: none
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```rust
/// #[derive(ReferenceDoc)]
/// struct MyStruct {
///      /// This comment will appear for `field`, and can contain markdown.
///      /// It will be prefixed by a generated heading.
///      ///
///      /// Other comments may link to the generated heading using the hash `#field`.
///      /// For example, [this](#field) is a self-referencing link.
///      field: i32,
/// }
/// ```
