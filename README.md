# Peridot

Peridot is a framework for composed, intelligent and distributed user
experiences.

Applications not explicitly designed to interoperate (and possibly implemented
in different programming languages) are ephemerally downloaded and dynamically
composed to run in a shared context. The framework manages application
lifecycle, resources and view hierarchy; and well as context and suggestion
infrastructure.

State of Peridot experiences is transparently synchronized across user devices
using a distributed offline-first storage system.
