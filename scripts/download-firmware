# This script downloads firmware as prebuilts from Google Storage.

# This script is expected to be executed by Jiri as a runhook, or by individual
# developers who want to grab the latest prebuilts.  It takes no arguments, will
# download the latest version of the firmware, install it in the
# prebuilt/downloads directory, and update prebuilt/config.mk with the firmware
# prefix (so you shouldn't have to set PATH or anything yourself).
