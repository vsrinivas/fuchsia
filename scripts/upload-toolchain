# This script builds the Magenta toolchain and uploads it to Google Storage.

# builds infrastructure.  As such, it it organized to accept the arch target
# as an environment variable, since that is how Jenkins passes arguments from
# matrix build configurations.

# This script also assumes a directory structure based on the Magenta Jiri
# manifests.  Jenkins uses these manifests to sync the code.
