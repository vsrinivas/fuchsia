/// The control channel for an AccountHandler component.

/// starts instances of AccountHandler. We define which account the handler
/// should be handling one time via this channel rather than via startup flags to
/// provide additional flexibility given the range of scenarios:
/// * The account is completely new
/// * The account is being added to the current device for the first time
/// * Account information is already present on the local disk and is readable
/// * Account information is already present on the local disk but is not yet
///   readable because the disk is not yet decrypted.
