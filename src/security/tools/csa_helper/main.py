"""Determines the files that needed to be rebuilt by fx ninja.

The primary use of this script is to find which build targets were changed
by a particular CL or patch for use by the clang static analyzer.

The input will most likely be the compile_commands.json generated by GN
which is normally out/<build-dir>/compile_commands.json

The output is a json file containing the translation units (TUs) taken
from the input compile_commands.json of which the build targets were
modified by a fx ninja call.

The expectated workflow is:
  1. Check out the base fuchsia commit against which to apply the patch.
  1. Run `fx build`.
  1. Apply the patch.
  1. Run this script.
  1. Run analyze-build against the output of this script.
