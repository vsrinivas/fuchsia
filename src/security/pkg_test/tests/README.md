# Test Components and Packages for Security Tests for Package Delivery

Each security package delivery test is defined in a hermetic test package with
a top-level test component. This directory defines these packages and test
components. Note that defining the package usually involves finalizing fake
dependency components with test-appropriate configuration details such as
command arguments and/or configuration data.
