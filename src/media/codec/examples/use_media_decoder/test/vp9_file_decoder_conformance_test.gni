# Defines a component that runs a VP9 conformance test using local files. The output of
# the VP9 stream will be decoded into a YUV 4:2:0 stream. Once the decoding is complete
# the outputted stream's md5 hash will be checked against the truth located in the
# md5_file parameter.
#
# Parameters
#
#   ivf_file (required)
#     The path to the vp9 stream encapsulated in an ivf file.
#     Type: string
#
#   md5_file (required)
#     The path to the md5 file that contains the md5 hash of the decoded YUV 4:2:0 stream.
#     Type: string
#
#   y_tiled (optional)
#     Should the test required tiled output.
#     Type: boolean
#
#   test_specs (optional)
#     Additional test specifications to apply to the test defined above.
#     See `test_spec.gni`.
#     Type: scope

    # shared between the packages, there isn't an additional cost to doing it
    # this way besides the mild code smell.
