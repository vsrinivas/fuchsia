# Please refrain from adding dependencies to pinned_dependencies below without
# consulting //src/dart/OWNERS. This is here to allow the update_3p_packages.py
# script to ignore these packages when there is a version mismatch in their
# dependencies vs the dependencies flutter_tool relies on. It is a last resort
# optin to assist with the flutter-with-deps roller in rolling successfully, in
# scenarios where that version mismatch isn't really due to API incompatibility.
