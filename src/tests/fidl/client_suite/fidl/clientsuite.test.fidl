// FIDL client binding implementation tests.
//
// Flow of the FIDL client side test suite:
// - Clients start the [`Runner`] protocol as a discoverable protocol.
// - Test harness uses the runner protocol to check if a test is enabled.
// - Test harness uses the runner protocol to request that the client make a
//   particular method call. The run request includes the client end that the
//   request should be sent on.
// - Client calls the requested method and waits for a response from the harness.
// - Client classifies the response and returns it back to the harness on the
//   runner protocol.

// client_end, using arguments provided by the harness if needed. The client
// should then classify the result of that particular method.
//
// Result classifications work similarly to the result union used for flexible
// interactions. Each of the methods which request a particular client call has
// a return value which is a union that allows the result to be classified in
// one of three ways:
// - Ordinal 1: the return value of the method that was called.
// - Ordinal 2: any application layer error of the method that was called (as
//   specified by FIDL error syntax).
// - Ordinal 3: any error returned by the FIDL layer, including unknown
//   interactions, but also error types not actually transferred in the FIDL
//   internal result union. This field will always use the [`FidlErrorKind`]
//   enum.
