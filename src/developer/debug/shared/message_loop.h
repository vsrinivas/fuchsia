// is backed by the async-loop library, on the host (Linux & Mac) it is backed by a poll()
// implementation (see message_loop_poll.h).
//
// This message loop supports several types of tasks:
//  - Bare lambdas.
//  - Delayed lambdas (timers).
//  - fit::pending_task objects (normally generated by fit::promise).
//  - Async I/O events on file handles.
//
// The target-specific subclass can also watch for Zircon-specific async events (see
// message_loop_target.h for more).
