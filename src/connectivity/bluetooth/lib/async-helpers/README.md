# Async Helpers

A collection of traits, objects, and patterns found to be useful
in the development of async code on Fuchsia.

## Items that are appropriate for inclusion in this library:

* Higher level abstractions over futures and concurrency primitives.
* Generalized FIDL functionality
  * Such as tools for implementing server and client side hanging get methods.
* Async-specific test helpers
* Anything else you deem fitting!
