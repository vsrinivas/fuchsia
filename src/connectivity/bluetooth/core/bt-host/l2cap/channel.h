namespace bt::l2cap {

// Represents a L2CAP channel. Each instance is owned by a service
// implementation that operates on the corresponding channel. Instances can only
// be obtained from a ChannelManager.
//
// A Channel can operate in one of 6 L2CAP Modes of Operation (see Core Spec
// v5.0, Vol 3, Part A, Section 2.4). Only Basic Mode is currently supported.
//
// USAGE:
//
// Channel is an abstract base class. There are two concrete implementations:
//
//   * internal::ChannelImpl (defined below) which implements a real L2CAP
//     channel. Instances are obtained from ChannelManager and tied to
//     internal::LogicalLink instances.
//
//   * FakeChannel, which can be used for unit testing service-layer entities
//     that operate on one or more L2CAP channel(s).
//
// Production instances are obtained from a ChannelManager. Channels are not thread safe.
//
// A Channel's owner must explicitly call Deactivate() and must not rely on
// dropping its reference to close the channel.
//
// When a LogicalLink closes, all of its active channels become deactivated
// when it closes and this is signaled by running the ClosedCallback passed to
// Activate().

  // ACL-U links. A further requirement is that "[t]he minimum MTU for a channel is the larger of
  // the L2CAP minimum [...] and any MTU explicitly required by the protocols and profiles using
  // that channel." `max_rx_sdu_size` is always determined by the capabilities of the local
  // implementation. For dynamic channels, `max_tx_sdu_size` is determined through a configuration
  // procedure with the peer (v5.2 Vol. 3 Part A 7.1). For fixed channels, this is always the
