// Lifetime management and abstract command interface for opening and closing a
// dynamic L2CAP channel. This is an internal object representing an entry in
// and owned by DynamicChannelRegistry and does not implement the outward-facing
// l2cap::Channel interface.
//
// Opening a channel may take multiple steps before data packets can flow. This
// interface uses the terms "connected" and "open" to distinguish between
// connection creation ("connected" but not ready to transfer data) and
// establishment ("connected and open" when configuration completes and can
// transfer data).
//
// For channels opened on ACL-U links, the lifetime is described by Core Spec
// v5.0 Vol 3, Part A, Section 6, "State Machine."
//
// For channels opened on LE-U links, the lifetime of Credit Based Flow Control
// connection-oriented channels is not explicitly described, but operation is
// outlined in Core Spec v5.0 Vol 3, Part A, Section 4.22 to 4.24 "Signaling
// Packet Formats" and Section 10 "Procedures for Credit Based Flow Control."
//
// A channel is considered "not connected and not open" after disconnection by
// either endpoint. There is no "closed but not yet disconnected" state.
//
// This only drives the command transactions over a link's signaling channel to
// manage a specific channel and is not used to send or receive data over that
// channel (it exists in parallel with an bt::l2cap::Channel for that
// purpose). It is intended only to be run from the L2CAP thread.
