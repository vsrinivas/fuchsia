Description:

This directory contains OS agnostic code for the NXP fullmac driver. This code
was downloaded from the vendor's website and not from a repository. The
goal is to avoid any changes unless it is absolutely required to build the
code for Fuchsia. To this end an OWNERS file has been added to prevent
inadvertent formatting or other changes.

OSRB approval requested in fxbug.dev/101261.
Initial check-in of mlan code fxrev.dev/700142.

Local Modifications:
Added this file - README.fuchsia.
Added OWNERS file.
