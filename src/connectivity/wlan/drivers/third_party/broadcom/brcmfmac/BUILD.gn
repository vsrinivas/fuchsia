# The brcmfmac driver can be built with support for different system buses (PCIE, SDIO and
# simulated-firmware), and different configurations will require different support.  To facilitate
# consolidating all the potentially messy conditional compilation in one place, "binding.cc" is
# conditionally compiled based on the values of the preprocessor #defines:
#
# * CONFIG_BRCMFMAC_PCIE
# * CONFIG_BRCMFMAC_SDIO
# * CONFIG_BRCMFMAC_SIM
# * CONFIG_BRCMFMAC_DRIVER_TEST
#
# These #defines are applied as public_configs entries on the targets:
# respectively:
#
# * pcie/pcie
# * sdio/sdio
# * sim/sim
#
# Thus a target that depends on one of the above targets, can include "binding.cc" in its sources
# and will then conditionally compile it with the set of preprocessor #defines set by the targets
# it depends on.
#
# See the targets ":driver_module" and ":test_driver_module" to see how this is done.
