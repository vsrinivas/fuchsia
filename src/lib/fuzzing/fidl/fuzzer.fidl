/// A library of cross-process fuzzing protocols.
///
/// A fuzzer can be described in three parts:
///   1. The code under test.
///   2. A fuzz target function that maps each test input to the interface of the code under test.
///   3. A fuzzing engine that generates new test inputs.
/// For more details, see https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/testing/fuzzing/overview
///
/// LLVM's libFuzzer is a coverage-guided fuzzing engine. It includes a pair of interfaces for
/// coordinating test execution and coverage collection from one or more remote processes. LibFuzzer
/// refers to the methods invoked by the engine process and executed in a remote process as the
/// "FuzzerRemote" interface, and to the methods invoked by remote processes and executed in the
/// engine processto the "FuzzerProxy" interface.
///
/// Notably, these interfaces do NOT specify how calls are forwarded from the one process to the
/// other. Instead, the libFuzzer runtime (in the engine process) and the libFuzzerRemote runtime
/// (in the remote processes) both assume they will be linked against a transport library that
/// implements the each interface in the other process, i.e.:
///   * The engine process is linked against an implementation of the FuzzerRemote interface that
///     forwards to the remote process.
///   * The remote process is linked against an implementation of the FuzzerProxy interface that
///     forwards to the engine process.
///
/// The protocols in this library are designed to match these interfaces expectations and provide
/// a compatible Fuchsia transport library for libFuzzer using FIDL and Zircon objects.
