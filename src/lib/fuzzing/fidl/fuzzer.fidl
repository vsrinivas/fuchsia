/// A library of cross-process fuzzing protocols.
///
/// A fuzzer can be described in three parts:
///   1. The code under test.
///   2. A fuzz target client that maps each test input to the interface of the code under test.
///   3. A fuzzing engine that generates new test inputs.
///
/// Each execution of the code under test with a test input is a single fuzzing iteration. A fuzzer
/// will perform iterations repeatedly until a defect is found or some other stopping condition is
/// reached (e.g. a time limit).
///
/// In coverage-guided fuzzing, the code under test is instrumented to provide code coverage
/// information back to the fuzzing engine. The engine maintains a set of coverage-increasing inputs
/// called a corpus, and mutates these inputs to create new ones.
///
/// Source-based instrumentation can be added by the compiler, but this generally assumes all three
/// parts are combined into a single process. For general-purpose FIDL fuzzing on Fuchsia, these
/// parts need to be able to reside in different processes. The protocols in this library allow
/// the interactions between those parts to happen over FIDL interfaces.
///

/// Fuzzing engine interface to FIDL framework
///
/// When started, the fuzzing engine provides the |Coverage| and |DataProvider| interfaces, and
/// invokes the |LlvmFuzzer| interface to set up and begin fuzzing. This interface allows the
/// framework to provide the overall fuzzer configuration and wait for the engine to exit.

    /// above. It performs fuzzing iterations repeatedly in a loop, and does not return until:
    ///   * The engine reaches a stopping condition, e.g. `-max_total_time=3600`.
    ///   * The engine detects an error, e.g. libFuzzer's crash handler is invoked.

/// Aggregated sanitizer coverage data proxied from other processes.
///
/// For cross-process fuzzing. the code under test needs to proxy its code coverage data back to
/// fuzzing engine. The Coverage protocol describes this action, with the code under test as the
/// client and the fuzzing engine as the server. There are two types of methods:
///   1. Some coverage, such as inline 8-bit counters and PC tables, is written to specific memory
///      locations. This data is forwarded to engine by setting up shared buffers. These methods
///      correspond to the LLVM compiler_rt `__sanitizer_cov_*_init` functions supported by
///      libFuzzer.
///   2. Other coverage is associated with specific machine instructions being called, e.g. CMP
///      instructions. Rather than provide each traced instruction to the engine in a separate FIDL
///      call, a shared buffer is set up and the instructions are batched. The traced instructions
///      correspond to the LLVM compiler_rt `__sanitizer_cov_trace_*` functions.

/// code under test in addition to the fuzz target function. To achieve this, the fuzzing engine can
/// acts as a server for this protocol with the fuzz target function and one or more of the proxies
/// as clients.

/// is "fuzzer-stable", i.e. most mutations such as adding or removing bytes shouldn't radically
/// alter what data the consumers receive.
