/// An implementation of a pseudo directory that generates nested entries only when they are

/// that only a small fraction of all the entries will be interacted with at an given time.
///
/// [`lazy`], [`lazy_with_watchers`], [`lazy_attr`], and [`lazy_attr_with_watchers`] are used to
/// construct lazy directories.
///
/// A lazy directory contains two callbacks and a stream.  One callback, called `get_entry_names`,
/// which is used when a directory listing is requested.  Another callback, called `get_entry`, is
/// used to construct and actual entry when it is accessed.  A stream, called `watcher_events` is
/// used to send notifications to the currently connected watchers.
///
/// `get_entry_names` is provided with a position and a sink (in form of another callback).  The
/// position allows the caller to retrieve entry names starting at a point other then the very
/// first entry.  The sink is use to consume entry names and it may not be able to consume the
/// whole directory content at once as it is backed by a limited size buffer.  `get_entry_names` is
/// expected to return a new position that would allow the caller to continue the traversal from
/// the next entry.  See [`traversal_position::AlphabeticalTraversal`] for an example of a type
/// designed to be used as a traversal position.  `sink` will return Ok(true) if it can consume
/// more entries, and Ok(false) if it can not.  An Err() value is returned if the sink failed to
/// consume the entry specified.  When the traversal has reached the end of the listing, sink
/// should not be called at all - this is an indicator that we have reached the end.
///
/// And alternative to the current `get_entry_names` interface is to represent it as a closure
/// returning an iterator.  The iterator will return new position and the `EntryInfo`, name pair.
/// The problem with this approach is that Rust does not allow closures to return references to the
/// data they own (there is no way to express this in the type system currently).
///
/// `get_entry` is expected to construct an [`DirectoryEntry`] instance to back an individual entry
/// and return it.  This new entry is then owned by the lazy directory, which would run it as part
/// of it's own execution cycle.  When the last connection to this entry is closed, the entry
/// object will be destroyed.
///
/// Notice that currently there is no caching or sharing of entry objects.  Every new `open()`
/// request will cause new entry object to be allocated and used.  See #fxbug.dev/33423 for the caching
/// policy discussion.
///
/// NOTE I have considered using an iterator as the interface for `get_entry_names`.  So that
/// `get_entry_names` would return an iterator that would encapsulate the iteration position.  The
/// problem with the iterators is that they do not allow the value to be "put back".  There is an
/// [`iter::Peekable`], but it is not a trait - I would need to introduce a custom trait to support
/// this functionality which would partially remove the advantage of using a standard trait.
///
/// The other problem with iterators, is that they do not control the lifetime of the value they
/// return.  With the "sink", `get_entry_names` is providing a reference that need to be alive only
/// for the duration of the call of the "sink".  An iterator, if it is returning a reference, has
/// no control over the reference lifetime.  And if it is not returning a reference, then a copy
/// will happen, if the data could have been referenced, in cases when it relatively static.
///
/// The later may be partially addressed by generalizing the iterator over its return type, as done
/// in the [`watchers::Watchers::add`] in the next commit.  But this generalization will introduce
/// additional complexity.
///
/// `watcher_events` is a stream of events that when occure are forwarded to all the connected
/// watchers.  They are values of type [`WatcherEvent`].  If this stream reaches it's end
/// (`is_terminated()` becomes true) existing watchers connections will be closed and any new
/// watchers will not be able to connect to the node - they will receive a NOT_SUPPORTED error.
