// Other libc++ headers use <cstdint> but libc++'s <cstdint> complains if it
// thinks <stdint.h> is not its own wrapper, which we do not need.  We always
// get the real <stdint.h> before the libc++ with the way the include paths are
// set up, which is necessary because of other headers where preempting
// libc++'s header is unavoidable for the kernel environment.

#include <stdint.h>
