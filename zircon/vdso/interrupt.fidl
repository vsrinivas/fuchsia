    ///
    /// zx_status_t zx_interrupt_create(zx_handle_t src_obj,
    ///                                 uint32_t src_num,

    ///
    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// `zx_interrupt_create()` creates an interrupt object that represents a physical
    /// or virtual interrupt.
    ///
    /// If *options* is **ZX_INTERRUPT_VIRTUAL**, *src_obj* and *src_num* are ignored and
    /// a virtual interrupt is returned.
    ///
    /// Otherwise *src_obj* must be a suitable resource for creating platform interrupts
    /// or a PCI object, and *src_num* is the associated interrupt number.  This restricts
    /// the creation of interrupts to the internals of the DDK (driver development kit).
    /// Physical interrupts are obtained by drivers through various DDK APIs.
    ///
    /// Physical interrupts honor the options **ZX_INTERRUPT_EDGE_LOW**, **ZX_INTERRUPT_EDGE_HIGH**,
    /// **ZX_INTERRUPT_LEVEL_LOW**, **ZX_INTERRUPT_LEVEL_HIGH**, and **ZX_INTERRUPT_REMAP_IRQ**.
    ///
    /// The handles will have **ZX_RIGHT_INSPECT**, **ZX_RIGHT_DUPLICATE**, **ZX_RIGHT_TRANSFER**
    /// (allowing them to be sent to another process via [`zx_channel_write()`]), **ZX_RIGHT_READ**,
    /// **ZX_RIGHT_WRITE** (required for [`zx_interrupt_ack()`]), **ZX_RIGHT_WAIT** (required for
    /// [`zx_interrupt_wait()`], and **ZX_RIGHT_SIGNAL** (required for [`zx_interrupt_trigger()`]).
    ///
    /// Interrupts are said to be "triggered" when the underlying physical interrupt occurs
    /// or when [`zx_interrupt_trigger()`] is called on a virtual interrupt.  A triggered interrupt,
    /// when bound to a port with [`zx_interrupt_bind()`], causes a packet to be delivered to the port.
    ///
    /// If not bound to a port, an interrupt object may be waited on with [`zx_interrupt_wait()`].
    ///
    /// Interrupts cannot be waited on with the `zx_object_wait_` family of calls.
    ///
    /// ## Rights
    ///
    /// *src_obj* must have resource kind **ZX_RSRC_KIND_IRQ**.
    ///
    /// ## Return value
    ///
    /// `zx_interrupt_create()` returns **ZX_OK** on success. In the event
    /// of failure, a negative error value is returned.
    ///
    /// ## Errors
    ///
    /// **ZX_ERR_BAD_HANDLE** the *src_obj* handle is invalid (if this is not a virtual interrupt)
    ///
    /// **ZX_ERR_WRONG_TYPE** the *src_obj* handle is not of an appropriate type to create an interrupt.

    /// **ZX_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED** the *src_obj* handle does not allow this operation.

    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// `zx_interrupt_bind()` binds or unbinds an interrupt object to a port.
    ///
    /// An interrupt object may only be bound to a single port and may only be bound once.
    /// The interrupt can only bind to a port created with **ZX_PORT_BIND_TO_INTERRUPT**
    /// option.
    ///
    /// When a bound interrupt object is triggered, a **ZX_PKT_TYPE_INTERRUPT** packet will
    /// be delivered to the port it is bound to, with the timestamp (relative to **ZX_CLOCK_MONOTONIC**)
    /// of when the interrupt was triggered in the `zx_packet_interrupt_t`.  The *key* used
    /// when binding the interrupt will be present in the `key` field of the `zx_port_packet_t`.
    ///
    /// If the interrupt being bound is in a triggered state, then a
    /// **ZX_PKT_TYPE_INTERRUPT** packet will be sent to the port the interrupt is being bound to,
    /// with the timestamp of when the interrupt was triggered. This packet will need
    /// to be processed normally.
    ///
    /// To bind to a port pass **ZX_INTERRUPT_BIND** in *options*.
    ///
    /// To unbind a previously bound port pass **ZX_INTERRUPT_UNBIND** in *options*. For unbind the
    /// *port_handle* is required but the *key* is ignored. Unbinding the port removes previously
    /// queued packets to the port.
    ///
    /// Before another packet may be delivered, the bound interrupt must be re-armed using the
    /// [`zx_interrupt_ack()`] syscall.  This is (in almost all cases) best done after the interrupt
    /// packet has been fully processed.  Especially in the case of multiple threads reading
    /// packets from a port, if the processing thread re-arms the interrupt and it has triggered,
    /// a packet will immediately be delivered to a waiting thread.
