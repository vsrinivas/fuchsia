    ///
    /// zx_status_t zx_bti_create(zx_handle_t iommu,

    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// `zx_bti_create()` creates a new [bus transaction initiator](/docs/reference/kernel_objects/bus_transaction_initiator.md)
    /// given a handle to an IOMMU and a hardware transaction identifier for a device
    /// downstream of that IOMMU.
    ///
    /// *options* must be 0 (reserved for future definition of creation flags).
    ///
    /// Upon success a handle for the new BTI is returned.  This handle will have rights
    /// **ZX_RIGHT_READ**, **ZX_RIGHT_WRITE**, **ZX_RIGHT_MAP**, **ZX_RIGHT_INSPECT**,
    /// **ZX_RIGHT_DUPLICATE**, and **ZX_RIGHT_TRANSFER**.
    ///
    /// ## Rights
    ///
    /// *iommu* must be of type **ZX_OBJ_TYPE_IOMMU** and have **ZX_RIGHT_NONE**.
    ///
    /// ## Return value
    ///
    /// `zx_bti_create()` returns **ZX_OK** and a handle to the new BTI
    /// (via *out*) on success.  In the event of failure, a negative error value
    /// is returned.
    ///
    /// ## Errors
    ///

    ///
    /// **ZX_ERR_WRONG_TYPE**  *iommu* is not an iommu handle.

    /// **ZX_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED**  *iommu* handle does not have sufficient privileges.
    ///

    ///
    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// `zx_bti_pin()` pins pages of a VMO (i.e. prevents them from being decommitted
    /// with [`zx_vmo_op_range()`]) and grants the hardware
    /// transaction ID represented by the BTI the ability to access these pages,
    /// with the permissions specified in *options*.
    ///
    /// *offset* must be aligned to page boundaries.
    ///
    /// *options* is a bitfield that may contain one or more of **ZX_BTI_PERM_READ**,
    /// **ZX_BTI_PERM_WRITE**, **ZX_BTI_PERM_EXECUTE**, **ZX_BTI_COMPRESS**, and
    /// **ZX_BTI_CONTIGUOUS**.  In order for the call to succeed, *vmo* must have the
    /// READ/WRITE rights corresponding to the permissions flags set in *options*.
    /// (Note: **ZX_BTI_PERM_EXECUTE** requires **ZX_RIGHT_READ**, not **ZX_RIGHT_EXECUTE**.)
    /// **ZX_BTI_CONTIGUOUS** is only allowed if *vmo* was allocated via
    /// [`zx_vmo_create_contiguous()`] or [`zx_vmo_create_physical()`].
    /// **ZX_BTI_COMPRESS** and **ZX_BTI_CONTIGUOUS** are mutually exclusive.
    ///
    /// If the range in *vmo* specified by *offset* and *size* contains non-committed
    /// pages, a successful invocation of this function will result in those pages
    /// having been committed.  On failure, it is undefined whether they have been
    /// committed.
    ///
    /// *addrs* will be populated with the device-physical addresses of the requested
    /// VMO pages.  These addresses may be given to devices that issue memory
    /// transactions with the hardware transaction ID associated with the BTI.  The
    /// number of addresses returned depends on whether the **ZX_BTI_COMPRESS** or
    /// **ZX_BTI_CONTIGUOUS** options were given. The number of addresses will be one
    /// of three possibilities:
    ///
    /// 1. If neither is set, one per page (`size / PAGE_SIZE`).
    /// 2. If **ZX_BTI_COMPRESS** is set, `size / minimum-contiguity`, rounded up
    ///    (each address representing a run of *minimum-contiguity* run of bytes,
    ///    with the last one being potentially short if *size* is not a multiple of
    ///    *minimum-contiguity*).  It is guaranteed that all returned addresses will be
    ///    *minimum-contiguity*-aligned.  Note that *minimum-contiguity* is discoverable
    ///    via [`zx_object_get_info()`].
    /// 3. If **ZX_BTI_CONTIGUOUS** is set, the single address of the start of the memory.
    ///
    /// *num_addrs* is the number of entries in the *addrs* array.  It is an error for
    /// *num_addrs* to not match the value calculated above.
    ///
    /// The PMT retains a reference to the associated VMO, so the underlying VMO won't be
    /// destroyed until the PMT is unpinned.
    ///
    /// Resizable VMOs can be pinned. If a call to [`zx_vmo_set_size()`] would discard
    /// pinned pages, that call will fail.
    ///
    /// ## Options
    ///
    /// - **ZX_BTI_PERM_READ**, **ZX_BTI_PERM_WRITE**, and **ZX_BTI_PERM_EXECUTE** define
    ///   the access types that the hardware bus transaction initiator will be allowed
    ///   to use.
    /// - **ZX_BTI_COMPRESS** causes the returned address list to contain one entry per
    ///   block of *minimum-contiguity* bytes, rather than one per *PAGE_SIZE*.
    ///
    /// ## Rights
    ///
    /// *handle* must be of type **ZX_OBJ_TYPE_BTI** and have **ZX_RIGHT_MAP**.
    ///
    /// *vmo* must be of type **ZX_OBJ_TYPE_VMO** and have **ZX_RIGHT_MAP**.

    ///
    /// If *options* & **ZX_BTI_PERM_EXECUTE**, *vmo* must be of type **ZX_OBJ_TYPE_VMO** and have **ZX_RIGHT_READ**.
    ///
    /// ## Return value
    ///
    /// On success, `zx_bti_pin()` returns **ZX_OK**.  The device-physical addresses of the
    /// requested VMO pages will be written in *addrs*.  A handle to the created Pinned
    /// Memory Token is returned via *pmt*.  When the PMT is no longer needed,
    /// [`zx_pmt_unpin()`] should be invoked.
    ///
    /// In the event of failure, a negative error value is returned.
