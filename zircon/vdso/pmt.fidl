    /// ## Summary
    ///
    /// Unpin pages and revoke device access to them.
    ///
    /// ## Declaration
    ///
    /// ```c
    /// #include <zircon/syscalls.h>
    ///
    /// zx_status_t zx_pmt_unpin(zx_handle_t handle);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// `zx_pmt_unpin()` unpins pages that were previously pinned by [`zx_bti_pin()`],
    /// and revokes the access that was granted by the pin call.
    ///
    /// Always consumes *handle*. It is invalid to use *handle* afterwards, including
    /// to call [`zx_handle_close()`] on it.
    ///
    /// ## Rights
    ///
    /// TODO(fxbug.dev/32253)
    ///
    /// ## Return value
    ///
    /// On success, `zx_pmt_unpin()` returns **ZX_OK**.
    /// In the event of failure, a negative error value is returned.
    ///
    /// ## Errors
    ///
    /// **ZX_ERR_BAD_HANDLE**  *handle* is not a valid handle.
    ///
    /// **ZX_ERR_WRONG_TYPE**  *handle* is not a PMT handle.
