    // TODO(scottmg): Need something like handle:TASK in this file to mean {job, process, thread}.
    // Or otherwise some way to express multiple options for constraints on inputs in this protocol.

    /// ## Summary
    ///
    /// Suspend the given task. Currently only thread or process handles may be suspended.
    ///
    /// ## Declaration
    ///
    /// ```c
    /// #include <zircon/syscalls.h>
    ///
    /// zx_status_t zx_task_suspend(zx_handle_t handle, zx_handle_t* token);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// `zx_task_suspend()` causes the requested task to suspend
    /// execution. Task suspension is not synchronous and the task might not
    /// be suspended before the call returns. The task will be suspended soon
    /// after `zx_task_suspend()` is invoked, unless it is currently blocked in
    /// the kernel, in which case it will suspend after being unblocked.
    ///
    /// Tasks can be suspended and/or resumed before they are started. If a task is
    /// started while suspended, it will enter suspension before executing any code.
    /// Similarly, starting a new thread on a suspended process will suspend the thread
    /// before it executes any code.
    ///
    /// Invoking [`zx_task_kill()`] on a task that is suspended will successfully kill
    /// the task.
    ///
    /// A task cannot suspend itself or any of its parent tasks because it would never
    /// receive the suspend token and would be unable to resume execution.
    ///
    /// ## RESUMING
    ///
    /// To allow the task to resume, close the suspend token handle. The task will
    /// remain suspended as long as there are any open suspend tokens. Like suspending,
    /// resuming is asynchronous so the thread may not be in a running state when the
    /// [`zx_handle_close()`] call returns, even if no other suspend tokens
    /// are open.
    ///
    /// ## SIGNALS AND EXCEPTIONS
    ///
    /// There are two relevant signals that a thread can assert:
    ///
    /// - **ZX_THREAD_RUNNING**
    /// - **ZX_THREAD_SUSPENDED**
    ///
    /// Neither of these will be asserted until the thread is started via
    /// [`zx_process_start()`] or [`zx_thread_start()`]. When
    /// a thread starts, it will assert **ZX_THREAD_RUNNING** whether it is suspended
    /// or not, but if it is suspended will then switch to **ZX_THREAD_SUSPENDED**
    /// before executing any code.
    ///
    /// The **ZX_EXCP_PROCESS_STARTING** and **ZX_EXCP_THREAD_STARTING** debug
    /// exceptions will also be sent on start whether the task is suspended or not.
    ///
    /// ## Rights
    ///

    /// In the event of failure, a negative error value is returned.

    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// `zx_task_create_exception_channel()` creates a channel that will receive
    /// exceptions from the thread, process, or job.
    ///
    /// *handle* is the thread, process, or job handle to receive exceptions from.

    /// channel will be read-only with the following rights:
    ///
    /// * **ZX_RIGHT_TRANSFER**
    /// * **ZX_RIGHT_WAIT**
    /// * **ZX_RIGHT_READ**
    ///
    /// ### Number of Exception Channels
    ///
    /// Each task may have at most one regular exception channel and one debugger
    /// exception channel, except for jobs. A single job may have up to
    /// `ZX_EXCEPTION_CHANNEL_JOB_DEBUGGER_MAX_COUNT` debugger exception channels.

    /// number of channels for a given type will result in **ZX_ERR_ALREADY_BOUND**.

    /// ### Exception Messages
    ///
    /// When an exception occurs, the channel will receive a message containing one
    /// exception handle and one `zx_exception_info_t` data.
    ///
    /// The thread will remain blocked in the exception until the received exception
    /// handle is closed, at which point it will either resume or exception processing
    /// will continue according to the chosen behavior (see **ZX_PROP_EXCEPTION_STATE**
    /// in [`zx_object_get_property()`]).
    ///
    /// ### Unbinding
    ///
    /// Closing the created channel handle will unregister the exception handler. If
    /// an exception message is waiting in the channel at the time it's closed, exception
    /// handling will continue on to the next handler in the search order.
    ///
    /// ## Rights
    ///
    /// *handle* must have **ZX_RIGHT_INSPECT** and have **ZX_RIGHT_DUPLICATE** and have **ZX_RIGHT_TRANSFER** and have **ZX_RIGHT_MANAGE_THREAD**.
    ///
    /// If *handle* is of type **ZX_OBJ_TYPE_JOB** or **ZX_OBJ_TYPE_PROCESS**, it must have **ZX_RIGHT_ENUMERATE**.

    ///
    /// ## Errors
    ///
    /// **ZX_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED** The caller has a job policy in place preventing the
    /// creation of new channels.
    ///
    /// **ZX_ERR_ALREADY_BOUND** The maximum number of exception channels of the given
