    /// You can get the current state of the registers by calling
    /// [`zx_thread_read_state()`](thread_read_state.md#zx_thread_state_debug_regs).
    ///
    /// #### ARM Debug Hardware Debug Registers
    ///
    /// ARM debug registers are highly configurable via their DBGBCR<n> registers.
    /// However, Zircon limits that functionality to _Unlinked Address Matching_ HW
    /// breakpoints. This means that HW breakpoints will only issue exceptions upon
    /// exception on the given address in the corresponding DBGBVR register.
    ///
    /// Because of this, all the values within DBGBCR will be ignored except for the E
    /// bit, which is used to determine whether that particular breakpoint is activated
    /// or not. Said in another way, in order to activate a HW breakpoint, all that is
    /// needed is to set the correct address in DBGBVR and write 1 to DBGBCR.
