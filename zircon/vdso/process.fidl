    /// `zx_process_start()` is similar to [`zx_thread_start()`], but is used for the

    ///
    /// `zx_process_start()` causes a thread to begin execution at the program
    /// counter specified by *entry* and with the stack pointer set to *stack*.
    /// The arguments *arg1* and *arg2* are arranged to be in the architecture
    /// specific registers used for the first two arguments of a function call
    /// before the thread is started.  All other registers are zero upon start.
    ///
    /// The first argument (*arg1*) is a handle, which will be transferred from
    /// the process of the caller to the process being started, and an
    /// appropriate handle value will be placed in arg1 for the newly started
    /// thread. If `zx_process_start()` returns an error, *arg1* is closed rather
    /// than transferred to the process being started.
    ///
    /// Alternatively, *arg1* can be **ZX_HANDLE_INVALID** instead of a handle.
    /// In this case the process starts with **ZX_HANDLE_INVALID** (i.e. zero)
    /// in its first argument register instead of a handle.  This means there
    /// are *no* handles in the process and *can never* be any handles to any
    /// objects shared outside the process.  `zx_process_start()` is the only
    /// way to transfer a handle into a process that doesn't involve the process
    /// making some system call using a handle it already has (*arg1* is usually
    /// the "bootstrap" handle).  A process with no handles can make the few
    /// system calls that don't require a handle, such as [`zx_process_exit()`],
    /// if it's been provided with a vDSO mapping.  It can create new kernel
    /// objects with system calls that don't require a handle, such as
    /// [`zx_vmo_create()`], but there is no way to make use of those objects
    /// without more handles and no way to transfer them outside the process.

    /// address space by others.
