    /// Create a timer.

    /// ## Declaration
    ///
    /// ```c
    /// #include <zircon/syscalls.h>
    ///
    /// zx_status_t zx_timer_create(uint32_t options,
    ///                             zx_clock_t clock_id,
    ///                             zx_handle_t* out);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// `zx_timer_create()` creates a timer, an object that can signal
    /// when a specified point in time has been reached. The only valid
    /// *clock_id* is **ZX_CLOCK_MONOTONIC**.
    ///
    /// The *options* value specifies the coalescing behavior, which
    /// controls whether the system can fire the time earlier or later
    /// depending on other pending timers.
    ///
    /// The possible values are:
    ///
    /// + **ZX_TIMER_SLACK_CENTER**
    /// + **ZX_TIMER_SLACK_EARLY**
    /// + **ZX_TIMER_SLACK_LATE**
    ///
    /// Passing 0 in options is equivalent to **ZX_TIMER_SLACK_CENTER**.
    ///
    /// See [timer slack](/docs/concepts/kernel/timer_slack.md) for more information.
    ///
    /// The returned handle has the **ZX_RIGHT_DUPLICATE**, **ZX_RIGHT_TRANSFER**,
    /// **ZX_RIGHT_WRITE**, **ZX_RIGHT_SIGNAL**, **ZX_RIGHT_WAIT**, and
    /// **ZX_RIGHT_INSPECT** rights.
    ///
    /// ## Rights
    ///
    /// Caller job policy must allow **ZX_POL_NEW_TIMER**.
    ///
    /// ## Return value
    ///
    /// `zx_timer_create()` returns **ZX_OK** on success. In the event
    /// of failure, a negative error value is returned.
    ///
    /// ## Errors
    ///
    /// **ZX_ERR_INVALID_ARGS**  *out* is an invalid pointer or NULL or
    /// *options* is not one of the **ZX_TIMER_SLACK** values or *clock_id* is
    /// any value other than **ZX_CLOCK_MONOTONIC**.
    ///
    /// **ZX_ERR_NO_MEMORY**  Failure due to lack of memory.
    /// There is no good way for userspace to handle this (unlikely) error.
    /// In a future build this error will no longer occur.

    /// ```c
    /// #include <zircon/syscalls.h>
    ///
    /// zx_status_t zx_timer_set(zx_handle_t handle,
    ///                          zx_time_t deadline,
    ///                          zx_duration_t slack);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// `zx_timer_set()` starts a one-shot timer that will fire when
    /// *deadline* passes. If a previous call to `zx_timer_set()` was
    /// pending, the previous timer is canceled and
    /// **ZX_TIMER_SIGNALED** is de-asserted as needed.
    ///
    /// The *deadline* parameter specifies a deadline with respect to
    /// **ZX_CLOCK_MONOTONIC**. To wait for a relative interval,
    /// use [`zx_deadline_after()`] returned value in *deadline*.
    ///
    /// To fire the timer immediately pass a *deadline* less than or equal to **0**.
    ///
    /// When the timer fires it asserts **ZX_TIMER_SIGNALED**. To de-assert this
    /// signal call [`zx_timer_cancel()`] or `zx_timer_set()` again.
    ///
    /// The *slack* parameter specifies a range from *deadline* - *slack* to
    /// *deadline* + *slack* during which the timer is allowed to fire. The system
    /// uses this parameter as a hint to coalesce nearby timers.
    ///
    /// The precise coalescing behavior is controlled by the *options* parameter
    /// specified when the timer was created. **ZX_TIMER_SLACK_EARLY** allows only
    /// firing in the *deadline* - *slack* interval and **ZX_TIMER_SLACK_LATE**
    /// allows only firing in the *deadline* + *slack* interval. The default
    /// option value of 0 is **ZX_TIMER_SLACK_CENTER** and allows both early and
    /// late firing with an effective interval of *deadline* - *slack* to
    /// *deadline* + *slack*
    ///
