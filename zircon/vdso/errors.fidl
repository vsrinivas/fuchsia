// TODO(fxbug.dev/113897): `status` should be defined here and this should all
// be a single enum definition.

/// Indicates an operation was successful.
const OK status = 0;

// ======= Internal failures =======

/// The system encountered an otherwise unspecified error while performing the
/// operation.
const ERR_INTERNAL status = -1;

/// The operation is not implemented, supported, or enabled.
const ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED status = -2;

/// The system was not able to allocate some resource needed for the operation.
const ERR_NO_RESOURCES status = -3;

/// The system was not able to allocate memory needed for the operation.
const ERR_NO_MEMORY status = -4;

// -5 used to be ZX_ERR_CALL_FAILED.

/// The system call was interrupted, but should be retried. This should not be
/// seen outside of the VDSO.
const ERR_INTERNAL_INTR_RETRY status = -6;

// ======= Parameter errors =======

/// An argument is invalid. For example, a null pointer when a null pointer is
/// not permitted.
const ERR_INVALID_ARGS status = -10;

/// A specified handle value does not refer to a handle.
const ERR_BAD_HANDLE status = -11;

/// The subject of the operation is the wrong type to perform the operation.
///
/// For example: Attempting a message_read on a thread handle.

/// The caller-provided buffer is too small for this operation.
const ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL status = -15;

// ======= Precondition or state errors =======

/// The operation failed because the current state of the object does not allow
/// it, or a precondition of the operation is not satisfied.
const ERR_BAD_STATE status = -20;

/// The time limit for the operation elapsed before the operation completed.
const ERR_TIMED_OUT status = -21;

/// The operation cannot be performed currently but potentially could succeed if
/// the caller waits for a prerequisite to be satisfied, like waiting for a
/// handle to be readable or writable.
///
/// Example: Attempting to read from a channel that has no messages waiting but
/// has an open remote will return `ZX_ERR_SHOULD_WAIT`. In contrast, attempting
/// to read from a channel that has no messages waiting and has a closed remote
/// end will return `ZX_ERR_PEER_CLOSED`.
const ERR_SHOULD_WAIT status = -22;

/// The in-progress operation, for example, a wait, has been canceled.

/// The operation failed because the remote end of the subject of the operation
/// was closed.
const ERR_PEER_CLOSED status = -24;

/// An object with the specified identifier already exists.
///
/// Example: Attempting to create a file when a file already exists with that
/// name.

/// The operation failed because the named entity is already owned or controlled
/// by another entity. The operation could succeed later if the current owner
/// releases the entity.
const ERR_ALREADY_BOUND status = -27;

/// The subject of the operation is currently unable to perform the operation.
///
/// This is used when there's no direct way for the caller to observe when the
/// subject will be able to perform the operation and should thus retry.

// ======= Permission check errors =======

/// The caller did not have permission to perform the specified operation.
const ERR_ACCESS_DENIED status = -30;

/// Otherwise-unspecified error occurred during I/O.
const ERR_IO status = -40;

/// The entity the I/O operation is being performed on rejected the operation.

/// Example: an I2C device NAK'ing a transaction or a disk controller rejecting
/// an invalid command, or a stalled USB endpoint.
const ERR_IO_REFUSED status = -41;

/// The data in the operation failed an integrity check and is possibly
/// corrupted.
///
/// Example: CRC or Parity error.
const ERR_IO_DATA_INTEGRITY status = -42;

/// The data in the operation is currently unavailable and may be permanently
/// lost.
///
/// Example: A disk block is irrecoverably damaged.
const ERR_IO_DATA_LOSS status = -43;

/// The device is no longer available (has been unplugged from the system,
/// powered down, or the driver has been unloaded).
const ERR_IO_NOT_PRESENT status = -44;

/// More data was received from the device than expected.
///
/// Example: a USB "babble" error due to a device sending more data than the
/// host queued to receive.

/// Example: A USB isochronous transfer that failed to complete due to an
/// overrun or underrun.

/// The data in the operation is invalid parameter or is out of range.
///
/// Example: A USB transfer that failed to complete with TRB Error
const ERR_IO_INVALID status = -47;

// ======== Filesystem Errors ========

/// Path name is too long.
const ERR_BAD_PATH status = -50;

/// The object is not a directory or does not support directory operations.
///
/// Example: Attempted to open a file as a directory or attempted to do
/// directory operations on a file.
const ERR_NOT_DIR status = -51;

/// Object is not a regular file.
const ERR_NOT_FILE status = -52;

/// This operation would cause a file to exceed a filesystem-specific size
/// limit.
const ERR_FILE_BIG status = -53;

/// The filesystem or device space is exhausted.
const ERR_NO_SPACE status = -54;

/// The directory is not empty for an operation that requires it to be empty.
///
/// For example, non-recursively deleting a directory with files still in it.
const ERR_NOT_EMPTY status = -55;

// ======== Flow Control ========

/// An indicate to not call again.
///
/// The flow control values `ZX_ERR_STOP`, `ZX_ERR_NEXT`, and `ZX_ERR_ASYNC` are
/// not errors and will never be returned by a system call or public API. They
/// allow callbacks to request their caller perform some other operation.
///
/// For example, a callback might be called on every event until it returns
/// something other than `ZX_OK`. This status allows differentiation between
/// "stop due to an error" and "stop because work is done."
const ERR_STOP status = -60;

/// Advance to the next item.
///
/// The flow control values `ZX_ERR_STOP`, `ZX_ERR_NEXT`, and `ZX_ERR_ASYNC` are
/// not errors and will never be returned by a system call or public API. They
/// allow callbacks to request their caller perform some other operation.
///
/// For example, a callback could use this value to indicate it did not consume
/// an item passed to it, but by choice, not due to an error condition.
const ERR_NEXT status = -61;

/// Ownership of the item has moved to an asynchronous worker.
///
/// The flow control values `ZX_ERR_STOP`, `ZX_ERR_NEXT`, and `ZX_ERR_ASYNC` are
/// not errors and will never be returned by a system call or public API. They
/// allow callbacks to request their caller perform some other operation.
///
/// Unlike `ZX_ERR_STOP`, which implies that iteration on an object
/// should stop, and `ZX_ERR_NEXT`, which implies that iteration
/// should continue to the next item, `ZX_ERR_ASYNC` implies
/// that an asynchronous worker is responsible for continuing iteration.
///
/// For example, a callback will be called on every event, but one event needs
/// to handle some work asynchronously before it can continue. `ZX_ERR_ASYNC`
/// implies the worker is responsible for resuming iteration once its work has
/// completed.
const ERR_ASYNC status = -62;

// ======== Network-related errors ========

/// The specified protocol is not supported.
const ERR_PROTOCOL_NOT_SUPPORTED status = -70;

/// The host is unreachable.
const ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE status = -71;

/// Address is being used by someone else.
const ERR_ADDRESS_IN_USE status = -72;

/// The socket is not connected.
const ERR_NOT_CONNECTED status = -73;

/// The remote peer rejected the connection.
const ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED status = -74;

/// The connection was reset.
const ERR_CONNECTION_RESET status = -75;

/// The connection was aborted.
const ERR_CONNECTION_ABORTED status = -76;

// ======= VDSO-private errors =======

/// A task was killed during an operation. This is a private error that should
/// not be seen outside of the VDSO.
const ERR_INTERNAL_INTR_KILLED status = -502;
