// A class which helps callers write streaming data operations to the underlying device.
//
// This class provides the following value over calling "Journal::WriteData" directly:
//
// Client-side coalescing.
//
//   This class groups together contiguous operations, only transmitting them to the writeback
//   subsystem once necessary.
//
// Avoids blocking for large operations.
//
//   For operations which are larger than the underlying writeback buffer, caution must be taken to
//   avoid blocking on "Journal::WriteData", which creates a reservation, but does not begin
//   execution of the underlying data. To mitigate, this class begins execution of these data
//   writes if they are larger than an internal threshold (which is smaller than the entire
//   writeback buffer).
//
// Allows ordering control over "all data", but not between intermediate data writes.
//
//   Typically, when data operations are issued, the caller cares that they all occur before
//   a following action, but the order between those data operations themselves does not matter.
//   This class enables callers to |Flush()| all prior data requests, without imposing an ordering
//   on the data requests issued by |StreamData()|.
//
// This class is thread-compatible.

  // necessary. To identify completion, refer to |Flush()|.

  // Promises generated by |StreamData()| are ordered before invocations of |Flush()|.
