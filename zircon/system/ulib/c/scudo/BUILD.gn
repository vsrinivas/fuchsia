  # The code needs to be compiled separately for production and test use for
  # two reasons.
  #
  # The first reason only affects the flag-parsing code (src/flags.cpp): it
  # uses the `__scudo_default_options` callback function.  The test code wants
  # to define this to set special options needed by certain tests.  But
  # defining it by that name will also affect the production Scudo built into
  # libc, which the test should not do (and it makes it very hard to e.g. debug
  # the test linked against a libc containing a slightly different version of
  # Scudo than the code under test).  So both the flag-parsing code and the
  # test code must be compiled with `-D__scudo_default_options=<some other
  # name>` to make the test code safe.
  #
  # TODO(fxbug.dev/64175): The second reason is similar but more subtle and it
  # affects much of the code, both the Scudo code proper and the gwp_asan code
  # it incorporates.  These both use thread-local state that is directly
  # located in the thread structure when the code is built into libc, because
  # normal `thread_local` C++ variables are not available inside libc itself
  # (due to implementation constraints in the dynamic linker).  If the test
  # code is built the same way, then it will clobber the thread-local state of
  # the libc Scudo/gwp_asan code, which the test should not do.
