To run the bootsvc integration tests, boot with these boot cmdline arguments:

`userboot=bin/bootsvc bootsvc.next=bin/bootsvc-tests,testargument`.

This will tell bootsvc to execute its test suite instead of the usual boot
chain. The expected output from a boot in this mode is a unittest suite report
that says 0 failed tests.

To test that crashlogs are being added to bootfs, you need to add a CRASHLOG item
to the boot zbi.  For example, to add the contents of README.md as the crashlog:
```
$ scripts/build-zircon-x64 &&
  build-x64/tools/zbi -o build-x64/zircon.zbi build-x64/zircon.zbi \
    -T CRASHLOG README.md &&
  scripts/run-zircon-x64  -V -k  -q $(pwd)/../buildtools/linux-x64/qemu/bin \
    -c userboot=bin/bootsvc -c bootsvc.next=bin/bootsvc-tests
```
