# The test runners have no better way to determine that a ZBI test succeeded
# than to look for an exact string in the console log output.  zbi_test()
# targets produce metadata to drive the test runners, which tells them to
# match this particular string.  When booted in standalone mode, userboot
# prints this message after the initial process exits iff its return_code was
# zero, but shutting down.  This string includes some random data that
# shouldn't appear elsewhere, to avoid false-positive matches.
zbi_test_success_string =
    "*** ZBI test successful! MDd7/O65SuVZ23yGAaQG4CedYQGH9E1/58r73pSAVK0= ***"

# Build a ZBI file to be run as a standalone ZBI test.
#
# What we call a "ZBI test" is a test that consists of booting a ZBI and
# capturing its console log.  The test is considered successful if the
# $zbi_test_success_string is seen in the console log.  That string is emitted
# by userboot when given the userboot.shutdown kernel command line argument
# and the program it launched exits with a zero return code.
#
# zbi_test() is like a zbi() target, but specifically meant for ZBI tests.
# The ZBI always embeds kernel command line arguments to instruct userboot.
# Its metadata identifies this image as a ZBI test so it will be run, and
# prevents deps on a zbi_test() target from other zbi() targets from folding
# the ZBIs together (so a zbi_test() target can be thrown together with
# individual test() targets populating a full system image).
#
# The $target_name target is a group() that holds the metadata and is what
# should be used in deps.  The actual zbi() target is defined as
# "$target_name.zbi" so that e.g. get_target_outputs(":$target_name.zbi")
# can be used.
#
# Parameters
#
#   * args
#     - Required: List of kernel command line arguments,
#     e.g. `[ "userboot=bin/my-standalone-test" ]`.
#     "userboot.shutdown" is always appended to the list; this tells
#     userboot to wait for the launched process to exit and to log its
#     exit status and (if that's zero) $zbi_test_success_string before
#     shutting down.  Note "userboot.reboot" can still be added at boot
#     time to cause the machine to reboot instead of powering off.
#     - Type: list(string)
#
#   * tags
#     - Optional: See zbi() for full details.  The tag "disabled" here
#     causes this ZBI test to be disabled for bot runs.  It will still
#     be built and can be run manually, but won't be run automatically.
#     - Type: list(string)
#
# See zbi() for other parameters.
