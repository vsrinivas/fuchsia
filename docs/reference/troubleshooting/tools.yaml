   Expose structured state about a component. Monitor the state of a component at an
   instant in time.

   The Inspect tool allows a component to expose an arbitrary hierarchy of typed key/value pairs
   and update it over the course of its execution. This data can be snapshotted and inspected
   while the component is still running.

   Inspect is commonly used to represent information about the working set and recent history
   of a component to help during debugging.

   Component authors use Inspect by depending on a library in their language of choice (Rust, C++,
   and Dart are currently supported), and calling the appropriate methods to mutate their
   recorded state.

   Inspect data may be read using the <code>ffx component inspect</code>
   tool or <code>ffx target snapshot</code>.

 description: |
   Print string logs during the execution of a component.

   Fuchsia, like many systems, supports basic logging of strings to record some information
   when particular lines of source code are executed.

   Logs are aggregated by the Archivist component. They may be read using `ffx log`.

   Store structured key/value pairs in log messages.

   In addition to text-based logs, Fuchsia supports fully structured
   log records encoded as typed key/value hierarchies.

   Developers may write structured logs using the <code>tracing</code> crate macros in Rust
   or the <code>FX_SLOG</code> macro in C++.

  description: |
    Persistence stores Inspect data and publishes it on the subsequent boot.

    Sometimes Diagnostics data can't be exported from the device until it's
    rebooted, for example, if there's a problem with networking. Persistence
    writes selected Inspect data to disk and then publishes it back to Inspect
    on the next boot.
