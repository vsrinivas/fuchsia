# Bindings Reference

This section contains reference documentation for working with FIDL in
C++ ([HLCPP][hlcpp-bindings] and [LLCPP][llcpp-bindings]),
[Rust][rust-bindings], [Go][go-bindings], and [Dart][dart-bindings].
The documentation for each language includes (where available):

  * A reference guide to the code generated by the FIDL compiler from your `.fidl` files
  * Generated API documentation for FIDL libraries that are provided in each language

This section also contains guidance for developing your own bindings in a language
of choice - for details, see the [bindings spec][bindings-spec]
