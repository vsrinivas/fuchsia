## fi-0138: Cannot use out-of-line data with deprecated C bindings {#fi-0138}

Types that store data out of line using [envelopes][0138-envelops] are
generally disallowed in types or protocols that carry the
`@for_deprecated_c_bindings` attribute:

[0138-envelops]: /docs/reference/fidl/language/wire-format/README.md#envelopes

{% include "docs/reference/fidl/language/error-catalog/label/_bad.md" %}

```fidl
{% includecode gerrit_repo="fuchsia/fuchsia" gerrit_path="tools/fidl/fidlc/tests/fidl/bad/fi-0138.test.fidl" exclude_regexp="\/\/ (Copyright 20|Use of|found in).*" %}
```

Any protocol or type carrying the `@for_deprecated_c_bindings` attribute cannot
transitively include any of `table`, `union`, or `vector<T>`. This is because
the C bindings use a data layout that matches the FIDL wire format and generally
only support in-place message construction. This makes them a poor fit for
arbitrarily deeply nested out of line data, which creates messages of
potentially vastly variable sizes.

The C bindings are deprecated, and new uses of those bindings, or the
`@for_deprecated_c_bindings` attribute, are not allowed. Existing APIs that
still use the C bindings should not produce compiler errors unless new C-facing
APIs have been added or existing ones have been modified. Such modifications are
strongly discouraged, and should be coordinated directly with the FIDL team.
