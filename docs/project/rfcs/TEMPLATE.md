# Summary

A one paragraph description of the rest of the proposal.

# Motivation

What problem does this proposal solve?

# Design

This is the technically detailed version of your proposal.

# Implementation

How will you go about implementing this design? Can the change be made in a
single CL or does the change involve a complex migration of third-party
dependencies? Do you plan to structure the implementation into phases? What
dependencies exist at each phase?

# Performance

What impact will this proposal have on performance? What benchmarks should we
create to evaluate the proposal? To evaluate the implementation? Which of those
benchmarks should we monitor on an ongoing basis?

# Security considerations

What impact will this proposal have on security? Does the proposal require a
security review?

A good starting point is to think about how the system might encounter untrusted
inputs and how those inputs might be used to manipulate the system. From there,
consider how known classes of vulnerabilities might apply to the system and what
tools and techniques can be applied to avoid those vulnerabilities.

# Privacy considerations

What impact will this proposal have on privacy? Does the proposal require a
privacy review?

A good starting point is to think about how user data might be collected,
stored, or processed by your system. From there, consider the lifecycle of such
data and any data protection techniques that may be employed.

# Testing

How will you test your feature? A typical testing strategy involves unit,
integration, and end-to-end tests. Are our existing test frameworks and
infrastructure sufficient to support these tests or does this proposal require
additional investment in those areas?

If your system defines a contract implemented by other people, how will those
people test that they have implemented the contract correctly? Consider, for
example, creating a conformance test suite for this purpose.

# Documentation

Do we need to create or update any documentation to cover this feature? For
example, do we need to add or remove an entry from the project roadmap? Do we
need to change the architecture document? Would end-developers benefit from
documentation related to this proposal?

# Drawbacks, Alternatives, and Unknowns

What are the costs of implementing this proposal?

What other strategies might solve the same problem?

What questions still need to be resolved, or details iterated upon, to accept
this proposal? Your answer to this is likely to evolve as the proposal evolves.

# Prior Art and References

Is there any background material that might be helpful when reading this
proposal? For instance, do other operating systems address the same problem this
proposal addresses?
