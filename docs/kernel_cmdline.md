# kernel commandline options

The Magenta kernel receives a textual commandline from the bootloader,
which can be used to alter some behaviours of the system.  Kernel commandline
parameters are in the form of *option* or *option=value*, separated by
spaces, and may not contain spaces.

For boolean options, *option=0*, *option=false*, or *option=off* will
disable the option.  Any other form (*option*, *option=true*, *option=wheee*,
etc) will enable it.

The kernel commandline is passed from the kernel to the userboot process
and the device manager, so some of the options described below apply to
those userspace processes, not the kernel itself.

## gfxconsole.early=<bool>

This option (enabled by default) requests that the kernel start a graphics
console during early boot (if possible), to display kernel debug print
messages while the system is starting.  When userspace starts up, a usermode
graphics console driver takes over.

The early kernel console can be slow on some platforms, so if it is not
needed for debugging it may speed up boot to disable it.

## gfxconsole.font=<name>

This option asks the graphics console to use a specific font.  Currently
only "9x16" (the default) and "18x32" (a double-size font) are supported.

## userboot=<path>

This option instructs the userboot process (the first userspace process) to
execute the specified binary within the bootfs, instead of following the
normal userspace startup process (launching the device manager, etc).

It is useful for alternate boot modes (like a factory test or system
unit tests).

## userboot.shutdown

If this option is set, userboot will attempt to power off the machine
when the process it launches exits.
