// A semantic provider is an interface for the accessibility manager to get front-end semantic
// information. A front-end providing semantic information needs to implement this
// interface and register its implementation to the manager.

// This is a stub implementation and is currently a work in progress.
interface SemanticsProvider {
  // Return the accessibility node of the element that the input event hits in the semantics
  // provider. Returns null if nothing was hit.
