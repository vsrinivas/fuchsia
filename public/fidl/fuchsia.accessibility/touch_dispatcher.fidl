// The input receiver takes in input from presentations to send to clients of
// the touch dispatcher and may pass back modified input. Only one presentation may connect
// to the input receiver at a time. Upon being set active, a presentation client
// should connect to the input receiver and register itself to receive and send events.
//
// The input receiver accepts all input types, despite only supporting TouchDispatcher, to allow
// for support of other event dispatchers in the future.
interface InputReceiver {

    // The InputReceiver currently only keeps connection to a single client at a time.

    // and register itself before sending input events. Otherwise, the InputReceiver drops
    // the sent inputs.
    //
    // The setup protocol is done because the InputReceiver currently only supports connection to
    // a single presentation at a time. An existing client is disconnected from the InputReceiver
    // once a new client connects. Therefore, we specify that a presentation should always
    // reconnect upon being set active, as that is when the presentation can receive raw inputs.
    // Registration must be done to specify the ViewTree of the currently connected presentation
    // for hit tests.
