  // TODO(johngro): Get rid of the loopback flag ASAP.  Routing decisions (and
  // security surrounding routing decisions) should be much more sophisticated
  // than this.  This is just a placeholder until we have a design in place.
  // Eventually, I suspect that all of this will move up into the audio policy
  // manager and application clients will obtain capturers from and control
  // through the policy manager.

  // System Gain and Mute
  // TODO(mpuryear): remove this systemwide setting once device-centric settings
  // are plumbed into the system UI. Also, device-centric (and certainly
  // systemwide settings) should be moved out of the accessible-to-all public
  // audio interface and relocated to a more restrictive interface that is only
  // accessible by clients with the appropriate privileges (such as system
  // configuration API, or the governor of audio policy).
  //
  // Mirroring device-centric gain and mute stages, Fuchsia's systemwide Gain
  // and Mute settings are fully independent. Changing the value of one does not
  // change the value of the other. Both have the ability to silence a system
  // (or a device, in the case of device Gain/Mute). If Mute is true, or if Gain
  // is kMutedGain, the system is silenced regardless of the other. Similarly,
  // one's value does not restrict the other's possible values in any way.
  //
  // Sets the system-wide gain in decibels. |db| values are clamped to the range
  // -160db to 0db, inclusive. Gain changes do not affect the system Mute state.
  3: SetSystemGain(float32 gain_db);
  //
  // Sets/clears the systemwide 'Mute' state. Changes to this setting do not
  // affect the value of the system Gain.
  4: SetSystemMute(bool muted);
  //
  // Provides current values for the systemwide Gain and Mute.
  // When a client connects to Audio, the system enqueues an action (to be
  // executed once the system regains control) to send this newly-connected
  // client a callback with the current systemwide Gain|Mute settings. Further,
  // upon any change to the systemwide Gain|Mute values, the system will trigger
  // all registered callbacks, notifying clients of the new values.
  //
  // Calls to SetSystemMute or SetSystemGain that do NOT result in a change to
  // these values (e.g. calling SetSystemMute(false) when Mute is already false)
  // will not cause the callbacks to be triggered.
  // 
  // During and immediately following connecting to Audio, it is essential that
  // clients keep in mind the fundamental single-threaded nature of FIDL.
  // Specifically, if a newly-connected client registers a SystemGainMuteChanged
  // callback before returning, that client will (once the system has subsequent
  // opportunity) be notified via callback of the Gain|Mute settings at the time
  // the connection was established. If however a newly-connected client returns
  // from a FIDL message dispatch (returning control to the FIDL dispatcher),
  // then that client subsequently registers this callback, the client has no
  // way to learn the current Gain|Mute settings until they actually change.
