// This interface is implemented by a device shell. Dependencies and parameters
// are passed to it in Initialize() on startup. The device shell is also
// expected to implement Lifecycle in order to receive a Terminate() call on
// teardown.
//
// In one component instance there can only be one DeviceShell service instance.
// The ViewOwner request is sent to the separate ViewProvider service. This way,
// the device shell may be implemented as a flutter component.
//
// Teardown may be initiated by the device shell calling
// DeviceShellContext.Shutdown(), or by the system shutting down.

  // AuthenticationContext associated with |username|. |request| will then be

  //
  // A |request| is tied to a |username| because the device runner allows
  // multiple users to be logged in at the same time.
