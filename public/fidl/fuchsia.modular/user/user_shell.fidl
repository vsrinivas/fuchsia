// This interface is implemented by a user shell. Dependencies are passed to it
// in Initialize() on startup. The user shell is also expected to implement
// Lifecycle in order to receive a Terminate() call on teardown.
//
// In one component instance there can only be one UserShell service instance.
// The ViewOwner request is sent to the separate ViewProvider service. This way,
// the user shell may be implemented as a flutter component.
//
// Teardown may be initiated by the user shell calling
// UserShellContext.Logout(), by the user runner being terminated, or by the
// system shutting down.
[Discoverable]  // Created by user shell components.
