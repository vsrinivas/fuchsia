// to add new accounts or be able to get a |TokenProviderFactory| that can be
// used to provide specialized instances of |TokenProvider| to third party
// agents.
//
// This is only meant to be used by the Framework.

  // Removes an existing user account. This involves talking to account's
  // identity provider and revoking user credentials both locally and remotely.
  // This operation also deletes cached tokens for the given account.

  // TODO(ukode): Modify this api to take account_id and IDP as input once the
  // Account struct is cleaned up.
  //
  // If |revoke_all| is set to true, then all device credentials are revoked
  // both locally and remotely on the backend server and user is logged out from
  // all devices. If |revoke_all| is set to false, then credentials stored
  // locally are wiped. This includes cached tokens such as access/id and
  // firebase tokens and the locally persisted refresh token. By default,
  // |revoke_all| is set to false and deletes account only from that given
  // device.
