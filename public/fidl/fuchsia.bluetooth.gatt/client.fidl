  //      and |offset| is 0, the "Write Characteristic Value" procedure will be
  //      used.
  //   b. If |value| is value cannot fit within a single ATT request or a
  //      non-zero |offset| is requested, the "Write Long Characteristic Value"
  //      procedure will be used.
  //   c. If the characteristic does not claim to support the selected
