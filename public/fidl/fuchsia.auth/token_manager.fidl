  // in its secure data store and later uses it for minting short lived tokens.
  // The long lived persistent credential is stored on disk and persists across
  // reboots.

  // profile information in |user_profile_info| such as the user's email,
  // image_url, profile_url, first and last names as configured on the auth
  // provider backend system.
