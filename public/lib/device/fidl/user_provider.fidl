//
// An interface similar to this one, |UserContext|, is provided to the user
// shell. It also contains a method to request logout. The difference is of
// level of ownership and control:
//
// - A controller interface to one component instance is given to a component
//   instance which has control over the life cycle of the first component
//   instance. As such, the controller interface can be used by the controlling
//   component to change the life cycle of the controlled component.
//
// - A context interface to one component instance is given to a component
//   instance whose life cycle is controlled by the first component instance. As
//   such, the context interface can be used by the controlled component to
//   request a change to its life cycle (among other functions).
//
// In general, the separation of a service |Foo| implemented by a component, and
// the service |FooController| given to the client of that component (rather
// than |Foo| directly) is a hallmark of inversion of control that pervades the
// design of our services.
