Copies function declarations from vulkan.h (from Fuchsia mirror of the Khronos
vulkan_loader_and_validation_layers repo), and adds stub implementations.  The
purpose is to provide a null implementation of Vulkan which will fail any
attempt to create a VkInstances or VkDevice; this is useful for running host
tests on test servers that have not been configured with Vulkan.
