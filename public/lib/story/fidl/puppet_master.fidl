// full-screen experience of a Fuchsia device. A device can run multiple
// sessions (ie, when one device powers multiple kiosks); that said, sessions
// are siloed from each other.
//
// A session, concretely, is a collection of stories, their state, the modules
// within them, any agents that run to support the mods and the various UI
// shells (session and story shells).

  // session state) until StoryPuppetMaster.Execute() is called and returns OK.

  // ExecuteResult.
