// This service is implemented by an application that is meant to be run as an
// Agent.
//
// When an agent application implements the |Lifecycle| interface, it can
// receive a signal for when it should stop. An agent may be stopped for the
// following reasons:
// (1) ComponentContext::Done() is called by this Agent indicating that it has
// completed its work.
// (2) All AgentControllers associated with this agent are closed.
// (3) The system wants to optimize for resources.
// Once the framework delivers a |Lifecycle.Terminate()|, the agent application
// may exit itself, or is killed by framework after a timeout.
[ServiceName="modular.Agent"]  // Created by each agent.

  // Called when this Agent is first instantiated i.e. a process is created and
  // this interface is requested from the application. Any call of Connect() or
  // RunTask() will only be made after the Initialize() call.
  //
  // An Agent is instantiated when it is not running and if:
  // (1) Some component calls ComponentContext::ConnectToAgent() or
  // (2) A trigger causes a task to be run.

  // Called when some component tries to connect to this agent.
  // |requestor_url| is the identifier for the component which called
  // ComponentContext::ConnectToAgent().
  // |services| are the services that are provided to that component.

  // Called when some task identified by |task_id| is scheduled to run. The task
  // was first posted by this Agent using AgentContext::ScheduleTask(). The
  // return callback is called by this Agent when all work related to this task
  // is completed. Note that the framework may call Stop() before RunTask
  // returns.
  // TODO(alhaad): The current implementation allows the Agent to run a task
  // until its callback returns. Instead, we should cap task length with
  // strategies like budgets.
