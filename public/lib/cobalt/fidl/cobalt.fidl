module cobalt;

// Cobalt is the service used in Fuchsia to report metrics. This file contains
// interfaces that allow clients to report metric Observations to Cobalt.

// To use Cobalt, you must have a project id, metric id and encoding id
// registered with the Cobalt system. In the current verison of Cobalt
// registration consists of entries in the files "registered_encodings.txt"
// and "registered_metrics.txt" in //third_party/cobalt/config/production. Since
// the Cobalt servers also read these files, for now it is necessary to
// contact cobalt-hackers@google.com in order to register additional projects,
// metrics and encodings. We plan to build a self-registration system in the
// future.

// Usage: First use CobaltEncoderFactory to get a CobaltEncoder for your
// project. Then you add Observations using the Add*Observation() methods.
// Observations are accumulated by the CobaltEncoder and periodically sent
// to the Cobalt server.

// The maximum size of a single Observation is 100 KB.
const int64 kMaxBytesPerObservation = 102400;

// Response codes for Cobalt encoder operations.

  // Sending observations failed too many times or with an unrecoverable error
  // Try the send again later. OBSOLETE: This status is never used.
  SEND_FAILED,

  // The attempted operation failed because some precondition was not met.
  // OBSOLETE: This status is never used.
  FAILED_PRECONDITION,

  // An attempt was made to add an Observation whose seralized size exceeds
  // kMaxBytesPerObservation.
  OBSERVATION_TOO_BIG,

  // Cobalt's local cache is temporarily full and cannot handle any more
  // Observations at this time. This condition should be rare because Cobalt
  // will automatically send Observations to the server and clear the cache
  // when it starts to get too full. In the current version of Cobalt,
  // Observations are cached in memory so this error could possibly occur if the
  // server is down for a long time. In the future Cobalt will store
  // Observations in non-volatile storage making this condition much less
  // likely.

  // |observation| The string value to be encoded. Must be consistent with

  //             associated with this encoder's project ID. The specified

  //
  // |encoding_id| Must be an encoding ID registered with the Cobalt system
  //               and associated with this encoder's project ID. The
  //               ecoding must support values of type INDEX. Some encoding
  //               configurations may specify a maximum index and in that case
  //               |index| must not exceed that maximum.
  //
  // |index|  The zero-based index of the value to be encoded. This is an index
  //          into some enumerated set of values that must be maintained outside
  //          of the scope of Cobalt's client-side configuration system by the
  //          client of this API.  Cobalt treats the given |index| as opaque,
  //          except that human-readable string labels may optionally be
  //          associated with the indices in Cobalt's server-side configuration
  //          in a |ReportConfig|. This allows Cobalt to use these strings in
  //          place of the indices when generating reports. However there is
  //          no requirement to register a label with an index in order to
  //          use the index here. Also the label may be added or changed later.
