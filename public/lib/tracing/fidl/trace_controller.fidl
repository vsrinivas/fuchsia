interface TraceController {
  // Requests to start tracing with the specified |options|.
  //
  // The trace controller acknowledges the request when all
  // registered providers have been started or after |options.start_timeout_milliseconds| milliseconds.
  //
  // The trace controller emits trace data to |output| as a sequence of
  // binary formatted trace records.  Traces obtained from different providers
  // are delimited by metadata records within the stream.
  //
  // The trace controller is responsible for lightly validating the structure of
  // trace records as it copies them from trace buffers into the output.
  // In particular, it must verify the size of each record header to ensure
  // that the framing of trace records in the data stream is maintained.
  //
  // The trace controller does not validate the contents of the trace records
  // themselves.  For example, it should not try to check argument lengths in
  // events.  This ensures that the trace format can be extended without needing
  // to modify the trace controller.
