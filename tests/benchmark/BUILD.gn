# We follow the conventions of ../BUILD.gn for the organization of the sources,
# build rules, and packages, with the following modifications:
#
# 1. All the binaries used in tests are run through a device_runner invocation
#    configured in the .tspec file of the benchmark subdirectory.
#
# 2. The component binary as well as its package is named with a prefix that
#    tells the benchmark it belongs to, followed by "_benchmark", followed by
#    more name components as described in ../BUILD.gn. The tspec file is also
#    named like the benchmark, followed by "_benchmark", followed by ".tspec".

#
# HOW TO ADD A NEW BENCHMARK
#
# 1. Add a new subdirectory with rules for the test components (user shells,
#    modules, agents). Define all test components as executable_package()s.
#
# 2. Add the newly defined packages for all test components to
#    //peridot/packages/benchmarks/modular.
#
# 3. Add a tspec file for the benchmark in the newly added subdirectory.
#
# 4. Add an entry for the tspec file to the resources = field of the
#    modular_benchmarks build rule.
#
# 5. Add an entry for the test to run_modular_benchmarks.sh.
