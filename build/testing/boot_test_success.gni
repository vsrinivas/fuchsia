# The test runners have no better way to determine that a boot test succeeded
# than to look for an exact string in the console log output.  zbi_test()
# targets produce metadata to drive the test runners, which tells them to
# match this particular string.  When booted in standalone mode, userboot
# prints this message after the initial process exits iff its return_code was
# zero, but shutting down.  This string includes some random data that
# shouldn't appear elsewhere, to avoid false-positive matches.
