import("//build/testing/test_spec.gni")

# Defines a test that runs on a Fuchsia device.
# See: https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/components/build
#
# Invoking this template registers a component and a package such that running
# the test would involve pushing the package to a Fuchsia device, launching the
# component, and treating said component as a test.
#
# Example:
# ```
# fuchsia_test("my-test") {
#   package = ":my-package"
#   component = ":my-component"
# }
# ```
# The above can be tested with `fx test fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/my-package#meta/my-component.cmx`.
#
# Parameters
#
#   package (required)
#     The `fuchsia_package()` that contains the test component.
#     Type: label
#
#   package_name (optional)
#     The name of the above (`package_name` argument if specified).
#     Type: string
#     Default: get_label_info(package, "name")
#
#   component (required)
#     The component that implements the test.
#
#   Additional `test_spec()` parameters will be forwarded.
