# This file demonstrate how to use the bazel_build_action() template
# to run a `bazel build ...` command from Ninja. The main idea is
# that:
#
# 1) All inputs for the Bazel build command should be declared through
#    one of the `bazel_input_xxx()` templates, which create a corresponding
#    filegroup in the auto-generated @legacy_ninja_build_outputs repository.
#
# 2) These targets *must* be in the dependency tree from
#    `//build/bazel:legacy_ninja_build_outputs`, or the action will
#    not run correctly.
#
# 3) The corresponding Bazel target declaration should refer
#    to the inputs using `@legacy_ninja_build_outputs//:<filegroup_name>` if
#    possible, or alternatively as individual source files
#    `@legacy_ninja_build_outputs//:<file_path>`
#
# 4) The `bazel_build_action()` target must know where the command
#    places its outputs, relative to the workspace `bazel-bin/` symlink,
#    in case of success.
#
#    It must also provide output locations under the Ninja target_out_dir
#    or target_gen_dir for the Bazel outputs.
#
# In this example, the input file is a source file named `example_in.txt`
# and will be copied by a Bazel genrule() into an output file that is
# then hard-linked into $target_gen_dir/example_out.txt
#

group("build_action") {
  deps = [ ":verify_build_action" ]
}

# This defines the file "example_input.txt" in this directory
# to be visible in the @legacy_ninja_build_outputs Bazel repository.
#
# IMPORTANT: This target must appear in the dependency graph
# of //build/bazel/legacy_ninja_build_outputs, otherwise the
# bazel_build_action() below will not work properly.
#
# The name argument below is used as a filegroup() name in the generated
# @legacy_ninja_build_outputs repository and is hard-coded in the BUILD.bazel
# file in the same directory as this BUILD.gn one. KEEP THEM IN SYNC!
