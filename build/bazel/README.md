This directory contains _experimental_ support files for using
Bazel with the Fuchsia platform build. Nothing here is final and may break
at any time for now.

# REQUIREMENTS

Have a full Fuchsia platform checkout from Jiri, and run the following
on a Linux build machine (MacOS is not supported at the moment!)

# OVERVIEW

Now that you've been warned, here's how this is supposed to work:

- The `out/default/gen/build/bazel/workspace` directory is used
  as the Bazel workspace for all bazel commands invoked from Ninja.

- The `out/default/gen/build/bazel/output_base` directory is
  used to place all Bazel outputs.

- The `out/default/gen/build/bazel/bazel` wrapper script is used
  to launch a known prebuilt Bazel binary with the right options
  to support this setup, and other requirements of the platform
  build.

- All three are generated by running `fx build bazel_workspace` (which ends
  up calling targets in `//build/bazel/BUILD.gn`). The workspace content has
  a specific layout that mirrors the Fuchsia source tree with a few exceptions:

  - A top-level `BUILD.bazel` symlink to `//build/bazel/toplevel.BUILD.bazel`
    in the source tree.  This is the file you should modify to add new
    top-level targets in the Bazel build graph.

  - A top-level `WORKSPACE.bazel` symlink to
    `//build/bazel/toplevel.WORKSPACE.bazel` in the source tree. This is the
    file you should modify to add new external repositories to the Bazel
    project.

    Also keep this in sync with `//build/bazel/toplevel.MODULE.bazel` which
    will be used in the future when [BzlMod][BzlMod] is enabled to manage
    external dependencies instead or workspace directives.

  - A top-level auto-generated `.bazelrc` file to configure Bazel.
    Note that this does not support `--config=fuchsia_x64` and
    `--config=fuchsia_arm64` are per the Fuchsia Bazel SDK. Also note that
    the user's own bazel configuration file (e.g. `$HOME/.bazelrc`) will
    always be ignored.

  - Symlinks to all top-level entries in the Fuchsia source tree, except for
    `out`. This way, any source or configuration file will appear at the same
    exact location during the Bazel and Ninja builds.

    In other words, if you add a file at `$FUCHSIA_DIR/src/foo/BUILD.bazel`,
    it will be visible and will define a Bazel package at `//src/foo:`.

  - The `out` directory is not symlinked intentionally to ensure that Ninja
    outputs are not visible by default. Instead, these are exposed to Bazel
    on a case-by-case basis using special `bazel_input_xxx()` template calls
    in `BUILD.gn` files. For more details, see the corresponding section below.

- Other Bazel external repositories are generated through repository rules,
  for example the `@prebuilt_clang` repository will provide C++ toolchain
  definitions that use the prebuilt Clang toolchain available from the
  Fuchsia checkout.

  This is intentionally different from the `@fuchsia_clang` repository
  generated by `third_party/sdk-integration`, since this allows experimenting
  with C++ toolchain definitions, build variants and PIE-optimized machine
  code generation without conflicts with sdk-integration development.

- The GN `bazel_build_action()` template can be used to invoke a
  `bazel build ...` command from GN, and copy its outputs to a GN-compatible
  location. See `//build/bazel/bazel_build_action.gni` for details.

  The `//build/bazel/tests/build_action/` directory contains a working
  example, which invokes a Bazel build action from GN, then verifies the
  output.

- For debugging only, the `fx bazel` wrapper tool is provided
  to launch a Bazel command inside the Fuchsia workspace file. This will
  always update the Bazel workspace if needed.

  For example, use `fx bazel version` to print information
  about the version number, of `fx bazel workspace` to print
  the absolute path to the workspace.

  And `fx bazel build ...` or `fx bazel query ...` commands will work
  as expected.

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

The reasons why the `//build/bazel/toplevel.XXX` files are used, instead
of providing the corresponding files directly at the top of the source tree
are that:

- Developers cannot call Bazel directly from the Fuchsia source tree (which
  otherwise would likely fail with very confusing error messages).

- Bazel's traditional command line interface to configure Bazel is not
  compatible with the requirements of the Fuchsia platform build. In
  particular, the Fuchsia Bazel SDK samples use `--config=fuchsia_arm64`
  to specify the target device architecture, but this will not work here.

- Finally, Bazel support in the Fuchsia platform build is still very
  experimental, and is best considered an implementation detail, hidden
  from developer workflows.

Similarly, the reason why Bazel build artifacts are placed under
`out/default/gen/build/bazel/output_base`, instead of using the standard
location under the user's home directory (e.g. `$HOME/.cache/bazel/`) are:

- This allows `fx clean` to properly remove previous build artifacts.

- This increases the chance of using hard-links when copying Bazel
  build outputs to the Ninja output directory, since in many setups,
  $HOME lives in a different partition / mount point than
  the Fuchsia checkout.

- This prevents filling up the user-specific directory with hundreds
  of GiBs of build artifacts that can be hard to clean up properly
  (e.g. when deleting a Fuchsia checkout directory manually with `rm -rf`).

  In particular, a Bazel module extension is used to generate a repository
  named `@prebuilt_clang` that provides C++ toolchain instances and
  configurations for the build.

- The Fuchsia platform build also relies on the new [Platforms][Platforms]
  feature, which impacts how toolchain selection happens inside a given
  build configuration. See `//build/bazel/platforms/BUILD.bazel` for more
  details.

# NINJA OUTPUTS AS BAZEL INPUTS

The `@legacy_ninja_build_outputs` external repository is used by the Bazel
workspace to expose Ninja build outputs as Bazel input files. This works
in the following way:

- Fuchsia platform `BUILD.gn` files must use `bazel_input_xxx()` templates
  (see `//build/bazel/bazel_inputs.gni` for documentation) to expose Ninja
  output files as Bazel top-level `filegroup()` targets in the
  `@legacy_ninja_build_outputs` repository (note that this name is long to
  discourage its use out of specific requirements).

  For example, the following GN target definition:

```py
  # An action that generates two files.
  action("generator") {
    ...
    outputs = [
      "$target_gen_dir/foo",
      "$target_gen_dir/bar/zoo",
    ]
  }

  # A target that exposes these outputs files to Bazel
  # as @legacy_ninja_build_outputs//:generated_files.
  bazel_inputs_resource("bazel_inputs") {
    name = "generated_files"
    sources = get_target_outputs(":generated")
    outputs = [ "generated/{{source_file_part}}" ]
  }
```

  Will end up generating the following Bazel target declaration that
  will appear in the auto-generated `@legacy_ninja_build_outputs//BUILD.bazel`
  file:

```py
  # From //....../...:bazel_inputs
  filegroup(
      name = "generated_files",
      srcs = [
        "generated/foo",
        "generated/zoo",
      ]
  )
```

  Note that the `bar` path segment has disappeared due to the way
  `{{source_file_part}}` works in GN, use `bazel_input_resource_tree()`
  if you want to preserve it instead.

- All `bazel_input_xxx()` GN targets *MUST* be reachable from the special GN
  target `//build/bazel:legacy_ninja_build_outputs`. More specifically
  from the transitive dependencies of its `inputs_deps` list.

  If not, these targets will not generate a `filegroup()` in the generated
  repository `BUILD.bazel` file, and the corresponding Ninja outputs will be
  invisible to the Bazel workspace.

- The `bazel_build_action()` template defines a GN action that invokes a
  Bazel build command (passing a list of Bazel target patterns). Some of
  these commands do not depend on Ninja outputs and can be run directly.

  Those that depend on Ninja outputs should depend on the corresponding
  `bazel_input_xxx()` target, and ensure they invoke a Bazel target that
  references them through the appropriate label (as in
  `@legacy_ninja_build_outputs//:<name>`).

  See `//build/bazel/tests/build_action` for a concrete example of how
  this works.

- It is possible to perform Bazel queries directly after setting up the
  Bazel workspace (i.e. after running `fx build bazel_workspace`), without
  the need to generate all Ninja outputs before that. This can be handy
  to inspect changes during development.

  Technically, the content of the legacy repository is mostly symlinks,
  which points to locations in the Ninja output path, the repository rule
  ensures that empty files or directories are created on demand if the
  link target paths do not exist yet (otherwise Bazel would complain).

  Since Bazel queries are not concerned by the content of such files, only
  by their presence, they can return adequate results. The empty files will
  otherwise be over-written by Ninja build commands if needed.

- The 'testonly' property is not preserved across the Ninja / Bazel boundary,
  but a non-testonly `bazel_build_action()` cannot depend on a testonly
  `bazel_input_xxx()` target, as per usual with GN.

# BAZEL BUILD ACTION

The `bazel_build_action()` template, defined in
`//build/bazel/bazel_build_action.gni` is used to create a GN action that
will run a `bazel build <targets>` command in the Bazel workspace.

If such a Bazel target depends on a Ninja-generated output file, this must
be expressed by a dependency on a `bazel_input_xxx()` target, as explained
in the previous section,

After the Bazel build command completes, its outputs are copied from the
non-deterministic location in the Bazel output base into a stable location
under `target_out_dir` or `target_gen_dir` (as required by GN for all actions).

For a concrete example, see `//build/bazel/tests/build_action/` that
contains a working target that invokes a Bazel build command (that simply
copies an input file into a Bazel output), then verify that it worked
properly.

# CLANG TOOLCHAIN REPOSITORY

The Bazel build generates an external repository named `@prebuilt_clang`
that mirrors the content of the host Clang toolchain, and augments it
with Bazel-specific files. These are needed to define C++ toolchain
instances and configurations.

C++ Toolchain selection is performed using the new Bazel
[Platforms][Platforms] toolchain, which is very different to the
traditional use of `--crosstool_top`, which is why using this option
will not work.

Note that this is distinct from sdk-integration's own `@fuchsia_clang`
external repository, which defines a C++ toolchain that generates Fuchsia
binaries (while `@prebuilt_clang` is used to generate host binaries and
experiment with build variants and PIE-optimized executables, without
conflicts).

# TESTING

You can invoke `build/bazel/scripts/test-all.py` to verify that everything
works properly. This is used to verify regressions during development of
Bazel support in the platform build, what is does is:

1) Invoke `build/bazel/scripts/prepare-fuchsia-checkout.py`, unless
   the `--skip-prepare` option is used.

2) Invoke `fx clean` unless `--skip-clean` is used.

3) Setup the Bazel workspace, then run a series of tests to verify that
   things work properly.

Always try to add new tests when introducing new features under //build/bazel/,
and run this script when changing its implementation (for now this is all
manual, but will likely be automated in CQ in the future).
