# NOT RUN BY BUILD, REFERENCE ONLY ---------------------------------------------

# Generates a static line_lookup_test used in the ModuleSymbols tests.
# This output should not change, as the tests heavily rely on the binary layout
# being the same. Ideally, we would have a way of extracting only the debug
# information and test against that, instead on relying on pre-compiled
# binaries.
#
# This rule is run offline for the x64 architecture and the result is checked
# in for the testing.
#
# TO UPDATE
#
#  - Uncomment this target.
#  - Add a reference to it from some target that is in the build (one of the
#    above ones is fine).
#  - Build an x64 build. As of this writing it will generate
#    "<out_dir>/x64-shared/lib.unstripped/libsymbol_test_so.so".
#  - Copy that file to "libsymbol_test_so.targetso" in this directory.
