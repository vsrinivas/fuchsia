/// access debug services that normally accept only local connections.
///
/// For example, if web browser exposes a debug HTTP service listening on
/// [::1]:9999, TcpProxyControl may listen on [::]:10000 and forward requests
/// to port 9999. The host test then calls port 10000 to access the web browser's
/// debug service.
