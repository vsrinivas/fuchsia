# What is this crate used for?

Documentation tooling at the time of writing.

# Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

No.

# What differs from upstream?

Files with incompatible licenses have been removed from the third_party directory. They were only
used for generating test cases which are not run in the Fuchsia build.

# Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

Make sure that only approved licenses are included in the code and test data for future versions.

# Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
