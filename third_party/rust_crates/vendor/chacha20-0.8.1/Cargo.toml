description = "The ChaCha20 stream cipher (RFC 8439) implemented in pure Rust using traits\nfrom the RustCrypto `cipher` crate, with optional architecture-specific\nhardware acceleration (AVX2, SSE2). Additionally provides the ChaCha8, ChaCha12,\nXChaCha20, XChaCha12 and XChaCha8 stream ciphers, and also optional\nrand_core-compatible RNGs based on those ciphers.\n"
