A FAT filesystem library implemented in Rust.

Features:
* read/write file using standard Read/Write traits
* read directory contents
* create/remove file or directory
* rename/move file or directory
* read/write file timestamps (updated automatically if `chrono` feature is enabled)
* format volume
* FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 compatibility
* LFN (Long File Names) extension is supported
* Basic no_std environment support

Usage
-----

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

    [dependencies]
    fatfs = "0.3"

and this to your crate root:

    extern crate fatfs;

You can start using the `fatfs` library now:

    let img_file = File::open("fat.img")?;
    let fs = fatfs::FileSystem::new(img_file, fatfs::FsOptions::new())?;
    let root_dir = fs.root_dir();
    let mut file = root_dir.create_file("hello.txt")?;
    file.write_all(b"Hello World!")?;

Note: it is recommended to wrap the underlying file struct in a buffering/caching object like `BufStream` from `fscommon` crate. For example:

    extern crate fscommon;
    let buf_stream = BufStream::new(img_file);
    let fs = fatfs::FileSystem::new(buf_stream, fatfs::FsOptions::new())?;

See more examples in the `examples` subdirectory.

no_std usage
------------

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

    [dependencies]
    fatfs = { version = "0.3", features = ["core_io"], default-features = false }

For building in `no_std` mode a Rust compiler version compatible with `core_io` crate is required.

For now `core_io` supports only nightly Rust channel. See a date suffix in latest `core_io` crate version for exact
compiler version.

Additional features:

* `lfn` - LFN (long file name) support
* `alloc` - use `alloc` crate for dynamic allocation. Needed for API which uses `String` type. You may have to provide
a memory allocator implementation.
* `unicode` - use Unicode-compatible case conversion in file names - you may want to have it disabled for lower memory
footprint

Note: above features are enabled by default and were designed primarily for `no_std` usage.
