Description: A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture.
Local Modifications:
  - See https://fxbug.dev/84480.
  - Rename VERSION file to RELEASE_VERSION in response to
    https://bugs.fuchsia.dev/p/fuchsia/issues/detail?id=88184#c6. This is to
    avoid issues with case-insensitive filesystems as the C++ standard library
    includes the line `#include <version>` in various headers.
