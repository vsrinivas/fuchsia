Revision: eb80ac77a6cdb3509d885d23d1dd343803381176
License: BSD 3-clause

Modifications:
- Kept only src/aarch64, removed everything else.
- sed -i 's/\.2d\[/.d[/' src/aarch64/*.S
  This works around https://bugs.llvm.org//show_bug.cgi?id=34488
  by making the code use the official syntax, not a variant GAS accepts.
- The no-neon directory is taken from an earlier revision of the same repo:
  bc654e7a594385071b42db3c9c94bd0fd5fe0da5
  It contains only a subset of src/aarch64 from that revision.
