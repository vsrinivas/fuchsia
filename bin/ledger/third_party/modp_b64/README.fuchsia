The modp_b64.c file was modified to remove the inclusion of modp's config.h
and to fix compilation errors that occur under VC8.  The file was renamed
modp_b64.cc to force it to be compiled as C++ so that the inclusion of
basictypes.h could be possible.

The modp_b64.cc and modp_b64.h files were modified to make them safe on
64-bit systems.
The modp_b64.cc was modified to avoid misaligned read/write on
little-endian hardware.

modp_b64 was modified to produce base64url.
