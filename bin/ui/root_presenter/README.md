# Mozart Root Presenter

This directory contains the Root Presenter, a service which binds view trees
to a renderer and provides input.

This application must be run within an environment that includes the
compositor and view manager.

See also the Launch program which is used to launch a view provider
application and ask the Presenter in its environment to display it.

## USAGE

This program should not be run directly.

Use launch instead.
