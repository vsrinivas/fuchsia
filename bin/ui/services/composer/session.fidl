interface Session {
  // Enqueue a list of operations, which will not take effect until Present() is
  // called.  It is allowable to call Enqueue() several times before calling
  // Present(); the effect is the same as if all operations had been
  // concatenated into a single Enqueue() call.
  Enqueue(array<Op> op);

  // Present all previously enqueued operations.  In order to pipeline the
  // preparation of the resources required to render the scene, two lists of
  // events are passed.
  //
  // |wait_events| are used by Mozart to wait until all of the session's
  // resources are ready to render (or to allow downstream components, such as
  // the Vulkan driver, to wait for these resources).
  //
  // For example, Fuchsia's Vulkan driver allows an mx::event to be obtained
  // from a VkSemaphore.  This allows a Mozart client to submit a Vulkan command
  // buffer to generate images/meshes/etc., and instructing Vulkan to signal a
  // VkSemaphore when it is done.  By inserting the mx::event corresponding to
  // this semaphore into |wait_events|, the client allows Mozart to submit work
  // to the Vulkan driver without waiting on the CPU for the event to be
  // signalled.
  //
  // |signal_events| is a list of events that will be signalled by Mozart when
  // the updated session state has been fully committed: future frames will be
  // rendered using this state, and all frames generated using previous session
  // states have been fully-rendered and presented to the display.
  //
  // Together, |wait_events| and |signal_events| are intended to allow clients
  // to implement strategies such as double-buffering.  For example, a client
  // might do the following:
  //   1) create two Image with resource IDs #1 and #2.
  //   2) create two Materials with resource IDs #3 and #4, which respectively
  //      use Images #1 and #2 as their texture.
  //   3) create a tree of Nodes and attach them to the scene.
  //   4) set one of the nodes above, say #5, to use Material #3.
  //   5) submit a Vulkan command-buffer which renders into Image #1, and
  //      will signal a VkSemaphore.
  //   6) call Present() with one wait-event (obtained from the VkSemaphore
  //      above) and one newly-created signal-event.
  //
  // After the steps above, Mozart will use the commited session state to render
  // frames whenever necessary.  When the client wants to display something
  // different than Image #1, it would do something similar to steps 4) to 6):
  //   7) set Node #5 to use Material #4.
  //   8) submit a Vulkan command-buffer which renders into Image #1, and
  //      will signal a VkSemaphore.
  //   9) call Present() with one wait-event (obtained from the VkSemaphore
  //      above) and one newly-created signal-event.
  //
  // Finally, to continually draw new content, the client could repeat steps
  // 4) to 9), with one important difference: step 5) must wait on the event
  // signalled by step 9).  Otherwise, it might render into Image #1 while that
  // image is still being used by Mozart to render a frame.  Similarly, step 8)
  // must wait on the event signalled by step 6).
  //
  // The scenario described above uses one wait-event and one signal-event, but
  // it is easy to imagine cases that require more.  For example, in addition
  // to using Vulkan to render into Images #1 and #2, the client might also
  // upload other resources to Vulkan on a different VkQueue, which would
  // would signal a separate semaphore, and therefore require an additional
  // wait-event.
  //
  // Note: |wait_events| and |signal_events| are only necessary to synchronize
  // access to memory (and other external resources).  Any modification to
  // resources made via the Session API are automatically synchronized.
  Present(array<handle<event>> wait_events, array<handle<event>> signal_events);

  // Connect another client to the same Session.  The connection is made after
  // the most recent call to Present() has been executed by the Session
  // implementation.
  //
  // Discussion:
  // This is typically used by an intermediary to pre-populate a Session before
  // servicing a request for a new Session.  For example, see the documentation
  // for View::ConnectToSession(); it returns a connection to a Session that is
  // pre-populated with various resources with well-known IDs.  To implement this,
  // when the ViewManager creates a View, it creates a corresponding Session and
  // immediately pre-populates it.  Then, when the ViewManager receives the
  // View::ConnectToSession() message, it uses this Op to connect the interface-
  // request to the Session.
  //
  // The reason that this is an Op rather than  a Session::Connect() method is to
  // guarantee the sequencing.
  Connect(Session& session, SessionListener? listener);
