# Mozart

A collection of services and applications to support the graphical
user interface.

## Compositor

A service which renders graphical content expressed by applications in
the form of a composable scene graph.

## View Manager

A service which provides user interface capabilities to views (user
interface components implemented by applications), mediates their
interactions, and manages the state of the overall view hierarchy.

## Input Manager

A service which dispatches input events to views.

## Launcher

A simple application to configure the framebuffer, compositor, and view
system, then launch a view as the root of a new view hierarchy.

This project is intended as scaffolding to bootstrap the user interface
while we build the rest of the system.
