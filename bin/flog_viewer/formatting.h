// This file declares a bunch of << operator overloads for formatting stuff.
// Unless you want to add new operators, it's sufficient to know that you can
// just use the operators as expected, except that some of the overloads can
// produce multiple lines and therefore provide their own newlines.
//
// These operators are intended to be called after a label has been added to
// the stream with a trailing space. If the text generated by an operator is
// sufficiently short, the operator may add that text with no preamble and
// terminate it with std::endl. If the text has to be multiline, the operator
// first adds std::endl, then the multiline text with std::endl termination.
// Each line starts with begl in order to apply the appropriate indentation.
// The Indenter class is provided to adjust the identation level. Operators
// that take pointers need to handle nullptr.
//
