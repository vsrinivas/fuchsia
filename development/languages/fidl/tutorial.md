## About this tutorial

This tutorial describes how to make calls in C++ and Dart using the FIDL
interprocess communication (IPC) system in Fuchsia. FIDL stands for "Fuchsia
Interface Definition Language", but the word "FIDL" is commonly used to refer to
the infrastructure required to make these calls, including the FIDL language,
compiler and the generated bindings.

The Fuchsia operating system has no innate knowledge of FIDL. The FIDL bindings
use a standard channel communication mechanism in Fuchsia. The FIDL bindings and
libraries enforce a set of semantic behavior and persistence formats on how that
channel is used.

For details on the design and implementation of FIDL, see
[zircon/docs/fidl/](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/docs/fidl/index.md).

## Getting and building the FIDL source code

See the [instructions for getting and building Fuchsia](/getting_started.md).

The examples we will use for this tutorial are located inside Garnet at:
[garnet/examples/fidl/](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/master/examples/fidl/)

## FIDL architecture

FIDL is organized like so:

A FIDL **Application** is software that's designed to work with FIDL interfaces.
The primary thread in a FIDL application usually has a run loop to dispatch
calls and may have additional threads with run loops.

An application is called through its **Interface(s)**. Interfaces are reusable
and can be vended by multiple applications. An interface is defined with the
Fuchsia Interface Definition Language (IDL). The classes that bind an interface
to a language are generated by the FIDL compiler.

An application almost always implements the **ServiceProvider** interface, which
returns interfaces based on the name of the service. The FIDL client library
provides default implementations of ServiceProvider for all supported languages.

A **Service** is your implementation of an interface. Therefore, within a
particular FIDL application, there is one service per interface. In the FIDL
client library, you will see calls like `AddPublicService()` or
`ConnectToService()`.

![FIDL Architecture](fidl_architecture.png)

A
**[Channel](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/docs/objects/channel.md)**
is an [operating system construct for IPC (InterProcess
Communication)](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/docs/concepts.md#message-passing_sockets-and-channels),
although it works equally well between processes, threads, or even within a
thread. FIDL uses channels to communicate between applications.

A **Connection** is the request sent to a FIDL application to return its
**ServiceProvider** interface to another application. Requests for subsequent
interfaces are _not_ connections. A connection refers to the construction of the
initial channel between two applications.

The word **Client** is used in this document to refer to a FIDL application that
connects to a **Server** application. The difference between client and server
is an artificial distinction for this tutorial. A FIDL application you write can
be a client, a server, or both, or many.

## Hello World "Echo" interface

We'll start with a C++ echo service that echoes its input and prints "hello
world".

Open
[garnet/examples/fidl/services/echo2.fidl](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/master/examples/fidl/services/echo2.fidl).
A .fidl file defines the interfaces and related data structures that a FIDL
applications vends (makes available to other FIDL applications). An interface
can be used in any language supported by FIDL, which allows you to easily make
calls across languages.

<!-- NOTE: the code snippets here need to be kept up to date manually by
     copy-pasting from the actual source code. Please update a snippet
     if you notice it's out of date. -->

The example file `echo2.fidl`, with line numbers added, looks like this:

```
1. library echo2;

2. [Discoverable]
3. interface Echo {
4.   1: EchoString(string? value) -> (string? response);
5. };
```

Let's go through it line by line.

**Line 1:** The library definition is used to define the namespace. FIDL
interfaces in different libraries can have the same name.

**Line 2:** The `Discoverable` attribute provides a name that can be used to
discover the service.

**Line 3:** The name of the interface.

**Line 4:** The method name. There are three unusual aspects of this line:

*   Note the `1:` before the method name. This is a **sequence number**, and is
    used to ensure backwards compatibility when there are multiple versions of
    the same interface. All methods must have a unique sequence number.
*   Note the `string?` declarations with a question mark. The question mark
    means that these parameters may be null.
*   The return type comes after the method declaration, not before. Unlike C++
    or Java, a method can return multiple values.

### Generated files

When you [build the tree](#getting-and-building-the-fidl-source-code), the FIDL
compiler is run automatically. It writes the glue code that allows the
interfaces to be used from different languages. Below are the implementation
files created for C++, assuming that your build flavor is `debug-x64`.

```
./out/debug-x64/fidling/gen/garnet/examples/fidl2/services/echo2.fidl.cc
./out/debug-x64/fidling/gen/garnet/examples/fidl2/services/echo2.fidl.cc.h
./out/debug-x64/fidling/gen/garnet/examples/fidl2/services/echo2.fidl.rs
```

## `Echo` server in C++

Let's take a look at the server implementation in C++:

[garnet/examples/fidl/echo2_server_cpp/echo2_server.cc](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/master/examples/fidl/echo2_server_cpp/echo2_server.cc)

This file implements the main function, and an implementation of the `Echo`
interface.

To understand how the code works, here's a summary of what happens in the server
to execute an IPC call.

1.  Fuchsia loads the server executable, and your `main()` function starts.
1.  `main` creates an `EchoServerApp` object which will bind to the service
    interface when it is constructed.
1.  `EchoServerApp()` registers itself with the `ApplicationContext` by calling
    `context->outgoing().AddPublicService<Echo>()`. It passes a lambda function
    that is called when a connection request arrives.
1.  Now `main` starts the run loop, expressed as an `async::Loop`.
1.  The run loop receives a request to connect from another application, so
    calls the lambda created in `EchoServerApp()`.
1.  That lambda binds the `EchoServerApp` instance to the request channel.
1.  The run loop receives a call to `EchoString()` from the channel and
    dispatches it to the object bound in the last step.
1.  `EchoString()` issues an async call back to the client using
    `callback(value)`, then returns to the run loop.

Let's go through the details of how this works.

### File headers

First the namespace definition. This matches the namespace defined in the FIDL
file in its "library" declaration, but that's incidental:

```cpp
namespace echo2 {
```

Here are the #include files used in the server implementation:

```cpp
#include <fuchsia/cpp/echo2.h>
#include <lib/async-loop/cpp/loop.h>
#include <lib/zx/channel.h>

#include "lib/app/cpp/application_context.h"
```

-   `echo2.h` contains the generated C++ definition of our `Echo` FIDL
    interface.
-   `application_context.h` is used by `EchoServerApp` to expose service
    implementations.

### main

Most `main()` functions for FIDL applications look very similar. They create a
run loop using `async::Loop` or some other construct, and bind service
implementations. The `Loop.Run()` function enters the message loop to process
requests that arrive over channels.

Eventually, another FIDL application will attempt to connect to our application.

### The `EchoServerApp()` constructor

Before going further, a quick review from the [FIDL
Architecture](#fidl-architecture) section. A connection is defined as the
_first_ channel with another application. Strictly speaking, the connection is
complete when both applications have bound their ServiceProvider to that first
channel. Any additional channels are not "connections". Therefore, service
registration is performed before the run loop begins and before the first
connection is made.

Here's what the `EchoServerApp` constructor looks like:

```cpp
EchoServerApp()
    : context_(component::ApplicationContext::CreateFromStartupInfo()) {
  context_->outgoing().AddPublicService<Echo>(
      [this](fidl::InterfaceRequest<Echo> request) {
        bindings_.AddBinding(this, std::move(request));
      });
```

The function calls `AddPublicService` once for each service it makes available
to the other application (remember that each service exposes a single
interface). The information is cached by `ApplicationContext` and used to decide
which `InterfaceFactory<>` to use for additional incoming channels. A new
channel is created every time someone calls `ConnectToService()` on the other
end.

If you read the code carefully, you'll see that the parameter to
`AddPublicService` is actually a lambda function that captures `this`. This
means that the lambda function won't be executed until a channel tries to bind
to the interface, at which point the object is bound to the channel and will
receive calls from other applications. Note that these calls have
thread-affinity, so calls will only be made from the same thread.

The function passed to `AddPublicService` can be implemented in different ways.
The one in `EchoServerApp` uses the same object for all channels. That's a good
choice for this case because the implementation is stateless. Other, more
complex implementations could create a different object for each channel or
perhaps re-use the objects in some sort of caching scheme.

Connections are always point to point. There are no multicast connections.

### The `EchoString()` function

Finally we reach the end of our server discussion. When the message loop
receives a message in the channel to call the `EchoString()` function in the
`Echo` interface, it will be directed to the implementation below:

```cpp
void EchoString(fidl::StringPtr value, EchoStringCallback callback) override {
  printf("EchoString: %s\n", value->data());
  callback(std::move(value));
}
```

Here's what's interesting about this code:

-   The first parameter to `EchoString()` is a `fidl::StringPtr`. As the name
    suggests, a `fidl::StringPtr` can be null. Strings in FIDL are supposed to
    be UTF-8, but this is not enforced by the FIDL client library.
-   The `EchoString()` function returns void because FIDL calls are
    asynchronous. Any value we might otherwise return wouldn't have anywhere to
    go.
-   The last parameter to `EchoString()` is the client's callback function. In
    this case, the callback takes a `fidl::StringPtr`.
-   `EchoServerApp::EchoString()` returns its response to the client by calling
    the callback. The callback invocation is also asynchronous, so the call
    often returns before the callback is run in the client.
-   Because the callback is async, the callback also returns void.

Any call to an interface in FIDL is asynchronous. This is a big shift if you are
used to a procedural world where function calls return after the work is
complete. Because it's async, there's no guarantee that the call will ever
actually happen, so your callback may never be called. The remote FIDL
application might close, crash, be busy, etc.

## `Echo` client in C++

Let's take a look at the client implementation in C++:

[garnet/examples/fidl/echo2_client_cpp/echo2_client.cc](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/master/examples/fidl/echo2_client_cpp/echo2_client.cc)

The structure of the client is the same as the server, with a `main` function
and an `async::Loop`. The difference is that the client immediately kicks off
work once everything is initialized. In contrast, the server does no work until
a connection is accepted.

**Note:** an application can be a client, a server, or both, or many. The
distinction in this example between Client and Server is purely for
demonstration purposes.

Here is the summary of how the client makes a connection to the echo service.

1.  The shell loads the client executable and calls `main`.
1.  `main()` creates an `EchoClientApp` object to handle connecting to the
    server, calls `Start()` to initiate the connection, and then starts the
    message loop.
1.  In `Start()`, the client calls `context_->launcher()->CreateApplication`
    with the url to the server application. If the server application is not
    already running, it will be created at this point.
1.  Next, the client calls `ConnectToService()` to open a channel to the server
    application.
1.  `main` calls into `echo_->EchoString(...)` and passes the callback. Because
    FIDL IPC calls are async, `EchoString()` will probably return before the
    server processes the call.
1.  `main` then blocks on a response on the interface.
1.  Eventually, the response arrives, and the callback is called with the
    result.
1.  `WaitForResponse()` returns, and the application exits.

### main

main() in the client is very different from the server, as it's synchronous on
the server response.

```cpp
int main(int argc, const char** argv) {
  std::string server_url = "echo2_server_cpp";
  std::string msg = "hello world";
  for (int i = 1; i < argc - 1; ++i) {
    if (!strcmp("--server", argv[i])) {
      server_url = argv[++i];
    } else if (!strcmp("-m", argv[i])) {
      msg = argv[++i];
    }
  }
  async::Loop loop(&kAsyncLoopConfigMakeDefault);
  echo2::EchoClientApp app;
  app.Start(server_url);
  app.echo()->EchoString(msg, [](fidl::StringPtr value) {
    printf("***** Response: %s\n", value->data());
  });
  return app.echo().WaitForResponse();
}
```

### Start

`Start()` is responsible for connecting to the remote `Echo` service.

```cpp
void Start(std::string server_url) {
  component::ApplicationLaunchInfo launch_info;
  launch_info.url = server_url;
  launch_info.directory_request = echo_provider_.NewRequest();
  context_->launcher()->CreateApplication(std::move(launch_info),
                                          controller_.NewRequest());
  echo_provider_.ConnectToService(echo_.NewRequest().TakeChannel(),
                                  Echo::Name_);
}
```

First, `Start()` calls `CreateApplication()` to launch `echo_server`. Then, it
calls `ConnectToService()` to bind to the server's `Echo` interface. The exact
mechanism is somewhat hidden, but the particular interface is automatically
inferred from the type of `EchoPtr`, which is a typedef for
`fidl::InterfacePtr<Echo>`.

The second parameter to `ConnectToService()` is the service name.

Next the client calls `EchoString()` in the returned interface. FIDL interfaces
are asynchronous, so the call itself does not wait for `EchoString()` to
complete remotely before returning. `EchoString()` returns void because of the
async behavior.

Since the client has nothing to do until the server response arrives, and is
done working immediately after, `main()` then blocks using `WaitForResponse()`,
then exits. When the response will arrive, then the callback given to
`EchoString()`, will execute first, then `WaitForResponse()` will return,
allowing `main()` to return and the program to terminate.

### Run the sample

You can run the Hello World example like this:

```sh
$ run echo2_client_cpp
```

You do not need to specifically run the server because the call to
`CreateApplication()` in the client will automatically launch the server.

## `Echo` server in Dart

The echo server implementation in Dart can be found at:
[topaz/examples/fidl/echo_server_dart/lib/main.dart](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/master/examples/fidl/echo_server_dart/lib/main.dart)

This file implements the `main()` function and the `EchoImpl` class:

-   The `main()` function is executed when the application is loaded. `main()`
    registers the availability of the service with incoming connections from
    FIDL.
-   `EchoImpl` processes requests on the `Echo` interface. A new object is
    created for each channel.

To understand how the code works, here's a summary of what happens in the server
to execute an IPC call. We will dig into what each of these lines means, so it's
not necessary to understand all of this before you move on.

1.  **Startup.** The FIDL Shell loads the Dart runner, which starts the VM,
    loads `main.dart`, and calls `main()`.
1.  **Registration** `main()` registers `EchoImpl` to bind itself to incoming
    requests on the `Echo` interface. `main()` returns, but the program doesn't
    exit, because an [event
    loop](https://webdev.dartlang.org/articles/performance/event-loop) to handle
    incoming requests is running.
1.  **Service request.** The `Echo` server package receives a request to bind
    `Echo` service to a new channel, so it calls the `bind()` function passed in
    the previous step.
1.  **Service request.** `bind()` uses the `EchoImpl` instance.
1.  **API request.** The `Echo` server package receives a call to `echoString()`
    from the channel and dispatches it to `echoString()` in the `EchoImpl`
    object instance bound in the last step.
1.  **API request.** `echoString()` calls the given `callback()` function to
    return the response.

Now let's go through the details of how this works.

### File headers

Here are the import declarations in the Dart server implementation:

```dart
import 'package:fidl/fidl.dart';
import 'package:fuchsia.fidl.echo2/echo2.dart';
import 'package:lib.app.dart/app.dart';
```

-   `fidl.dart` exposes the FIDL runtime library for Dart. Our program needs it
    for `InterfaceRequest`.
-   `app.dart` is required for `ApplicationContext`, which is where we register
    our service.
-   `echo2.dart` contains bindings for the `Echo` interface.This file is
    generated from the interface defined in `echo2.fidl`.

### main()

Everything starts with main():

```dart
void main(List<String> args) {
  _context = new ApplicationContext.fromStartupInfo();
  _echo = new _EchoImpl();
  _context.outgoingServices.addServiceForName<Echo>(_echo.bind, Echo.$serviceName);
}
```

`main()` is called by the Dart VM when your service is loaded, similar to
`main()` in a C or C++ application. It binds an instance of `EchoImpl`, our
implementation of the `Echo` interface, to the name of the `Echo` service.

Eventually, another FIDL application will attempt to connect to our application.

### The `bind()` function

Before going further, a quick review from the [FIDL
Architecture](#fidl-architecture) section. A connection is defined as the
_first_ channel with another application. Strictly speaking, the connection is
complete when both applications have bound their `ServiceProvider` to that first
channel. Any additional channels are not "connections." The function names will
make more sense if you keep this in mind.

Here's what it looks like:

```dart
void bind(InterfaceRequest<Echo> request) {
  _binding.bind(this, request);
}
```

The `bind()` function is called when the first channel is received from another
application. This function binds once for each service it makes available to the
other application (remember that each service exposes a single interface). The
information is cached in a data structure owned by the FIDL runtime, and used to
create objects to be the endpoints for additional incoming channels.

Unlike C++, Dart only has a [single
thread](https://webdev.dartlang.org/articles/performance/event-loop#darts-single-thread-of-execution)
per isolate, so there's no possible confusion over which thread owns a channel.

#### Is there really only one thread?

Both yes and no. There's only one thread in your application's VM, but the
handle watcher isolate has its own, separate thread so that application isolates
don't have to block. Application isolates can also spawn new isolates, which
will run on different threads.

### The `echoString` function

Finally we reach the implementation of the server API. Your `EchoImpl` object
receives a call to the `echoString()` function. It receives the arguments to the
function, as well as a callback function to return the result parameters:

```dart
void echoString(String value, void callback(String response)) {
  print('EchoString: $value');
  callback(value);
}
```

## `Echo` client in Dart

The echo client implementation in Dart can be found at:
[topaz/examples/fidl/echo_client_dart/lib/main.dart](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/master/examples/fidl/echo_client_dart/lib/main.dart)

Our simple client does everything in `main()`.

**Note:** an application can be a client, a service, or both, or many. The
distinction in this example between Client and Server is purely for
demonstration purposes.

Here is the summary of how the client makes a connection to the echo service.

1.  **Startup.** The FIDL Shell loads the Dart runner, which starts the VM,
    loads `main.dart`, and calls `main()`.
1.  **Connect.** The destination server is specified, and we request for it to
    be started if it wasn't already.
1.  **Bind.** We bind `EchoProxy`, a generated proxy class, to the remote `Echo`
    service.
1.  **Invoke.** We invoke `echoString` with a value, and set a callback to
    handle the response.
1.  **Wait.** `main()` returns, but the FIDL run loop is still waiting for
    messages from the remote channel.
1.  **Handle result.** The result arrives, and our callback is executed,
    printing the response.
1.  **Shutdown.** `dart_echo_client` exits.

### main()

The `main()` function in the client contains all the client code.

```dart
void main(List<String> args) {
  String server = 'echo_server_dart';
  if (args.length >= 2 && args[0] == '--server') {
    server = args[1];
  }

  _context = new ApplicationContext.fromStartupInfo();
  final Services services = new Services();
  final ApplicationLaunchInfo launchInfo = new ApplicationLaunchInfo(
      url: server, directoryRequest: services.request());
  _context.launcher.createApplication(launchInfo, null);

  _echo = new EchoProxy();
  _echo.ctrl.bind(services.connectToServiceByName<Echo>(Echo.$serviceName));

  _echo.echoString('hello', (String response) {
    print('***** Response: $response');
  });
}
```

Again, remember that everything in FIDL is async. The call to
`_echo.echoString()` returns immediately and then `main()` returns. The FIDL
client library keeps its own pointer to the application object, which prevents
the application from exiting. Once the response arrives, all of the handles are
closed, and the application will terminate after the callback returns.

### Run the sample

You can run the Hello World example like this:

```sh
$ run echo_client_dart
```

You do not need to specifically run the server because the call to
`connectToServiceByName()` in the client will automatically demand-load the
server.
